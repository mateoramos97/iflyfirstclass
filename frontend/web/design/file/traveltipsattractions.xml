The best way to get to the scenic beach village is to hop on the Glenelg Tram light-rail train in Adelaide&#38;rsquo;s CBD. The tram ride is just about a half hour and takes you through some of Adelaide&#38;rsquo;s neighborhoods. Glenelg itself is a classic beach town, complete with wide sandy beaches, sidewalk cafes and plenty of palm trees. Join a dolphin sailing tour at Holdfast Marina to spend some time swimming with wild dolphins, or take a boat out to snorkel and scuba dive along the reefs. For adrenaline-junkies, jet boat rides fulfill the need for speed, and visitors with a more contemplative side appreciate the town&#38;rsquo;s many fishing tours.&#60;/p&#62;

The church itself has taken many forms in its nearly 600 years of existence. Visitors today will find the church delightfully adorned with artwork, including Bernardino Buttinone&#38;rsquo;s &#38;ldquo;Blessed Reginald d&#38;rsquo;Orleans&#38;rdquo; and Giovanni Donato da Montorfano&#38;rsquo;s &#38;ldquo;Crucifixion&#38;rdquo; fresco. Tickets to see &#38;quot;The Last Supper&#38;quot; masterpiece are booked well in advance, so be sure to get your tickets as soon as you &#60;strong&#62;book your business class flight to Milan&#60;/strong&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;

At night, dine casually at the neighborhood&#38;rsquo;s family-run trattorias, then enjoy jazz music at the Blue Note. &#60;strong&#62;Taking a business class flight to Milan&#60;/strong&#62; doesn&#38;rsquo;t mean you have to spend all your time working or visiting the most popular tourist sites. Spending a little leisure time in a popular neighborhood like Isola gives you a chance to experience the community in a more personal and meaningful way.&#60;/p&#62;

The capital of the national bunraku scene, Osaka&#38;rsquo;s theater sports two halls and an exhibition theater hosting captivating performances. Bunraku has a long history, dating back to the Edo Period. Rather than an art form to entertain the elite, Bunraku gained popularity as a theater for the masses. Few Bunraku theaters remain in Japan, so Osaka&#38;rsquo;s large theater is a special glimpse into Japanese heritage and history. Locals even make the performances accessible by providing earphones broadcasting English translations. There&#38;rsquo;s no excuse to miss this unique Japanese cultural experience. After all, you didn&#38;rsquo;t &#60;strong&#62;take a business class flight to Osaka &#60;/strong&#62;just to experience the same-old attractions you could find in any major city.&#60;/p&#62;

It began construction in 1598, a symbol of Japanese unity. It was destroyed in 1615, rebuilt in the 1620s and destroyed again in 1665. In spite of this turbulence, Osakans never gave up and eventually rebuilt the castle again in 1931. When you visit the site, you&#38;rsquo;ll find a gleaming castle tower encompassed by citadels, impressive stone walls and protective moats. The castle houses a fascinating history museum, while the grounds include a popular concert venue, the beautiful Nishinomaru Garden and a shrine to the castle&#38;rsquo;s original creator, Toyotomi Hideyoshi. If you can choose your travel dates, try to &#60;strong&#62;arrange your first class flight to Osaka&#60;/strong&#62; for late March or early April so you can enjoy the cherry blossoms and their celebrations on the Osaka Castle grounds.&#60;br /&#62;

Although it is a Buddhist temple, the local acceptance of other religions is seen in Taoist and Confucian artistic influences. Beautiful paintings cover the temple walls; bronze dragon columns guard the central doorway, and statues of various gods are erected throughout the halls. Whether you&#38;rsquo;ve taken &#60;strong&#62;a first class flight to Taipei for pleasure or business&#60;/strong&#62;, make time to see Longshan Temple.&#60;/p&#62;

The artifacts span a period of 10,000 years of Chinese history. You&#38;rsquo;ll find amazing exhibits, from pottery created during the Neolithic Dawenkou period, 4300 to 2500 BCE, to Jade cups from the Western Han period, 206 BCE to 8 CE. Although the museum has a collection of more than 600,000 artifacts, only about 3,000 are on display at any given time. Pieces are routinely rotated into the exhibit, so there&#38;rsquo;s always something new to discover, even if you&#38;rsquo;ve &#60;strong&#62;traveled on business class flights to Taiwan&#60;/strong&#62; many times.&#60;/p&#62;

The National Palace Museum of Korea is housed in the south gate, and the on-site National Folk Museum displays more than 98,000 cultural, religious and folklife artifacts. You can spend an entire day exploring the various museums and structures. If you flew in on &#60;strong&#62;a business class flight to Seoul &#60;/strong&#62;for business, though, you may not have all day to enjoy the palace grounds.

The 14th-century founder of the Joseon Dynasty, King Taejo, rests on the top of the hill in the Geonwolleung tomb. Other royal graves include the twin tomb for the dynasty&#38;rsquo;s fifth king, King Munjong, and his wife, Queen Hyeondeok.

Perched atop a dormant volcano in the scenic Auckland Domain, the stately neoclassical museum offers incredible views of the city. Aside from the legendary Te Papa Museum in Wellington, Auckland War Memorial Museum is one of the most important museums in New Zealand. The site features collections of Māori, Oceania, New Zealand, military and natural history. Its Māori galleries alone contain more than 1,000 Māori artifacts, including the full-size Hotunui meeting house, the Te Toki ā Tāpiri war canoe and the oldest remaining Māori carving from the 12th to 14th centuries. There are also three daily Māori cultural performances, featuring an authentic haka.&#60;/p&#62;

The largest sport facility in all of New Zealand, Eden Park is home to national and international rugby union and cricket matches, soccer games, rugby league matches and countless special events. While cricket and soccer are popular in New Zealand, rugby union is really the national sport. That&#38;rsquo;s especially true for the national All Blacks team, the current holders of the Rugby World Cup. The All Blacks are known for performing the intimidating haka in front of the opposing team before each match. If your first class flight takes you to Auckland during the All Black season, be sure to catch one of their games at Eden Park. During the regular rugby season, Eden Park is home to the Blues.&#60;/p&#62;

    New Zealand is known for its extreme sports, so it&#38;rsquo;s natural that Sky Tower offers thrill seekers a chance to dive off the 1,000-foot-tall structure. This SkyJump uses a wire to complete your base jump, allowing you to fall at about 52 miles and hour. You can also walk around the outside of the tower at 630 feet above the ground.

It is believed that settlers have lived in this area since the 6th century B.C.E., and it remains the home of some of the oldest and most important Jewish and Coptic Christian sites in the region. It is also believed to be where the Holy Family sheltered while escaping Herod. The area&#38;rsquo;s Coptic Museum is a great place to begin your visit to Old Cairo. It outlines the history of the area and Cairo&#38;rsquo;s importance in the development of major world religions. From there, visit some of the earliest Christian churches: the 3rd-century Hanging Church; 5th-century St. Sergio, and 5th-century Church of Santa Barbara. You&#38;rsquo;ll also see Ben Ezra Synagogue, built in the 9th century; the oldest mosque in Africa, Mosque of Amr Ibn al-&#38;#39;Aas, and remnants of the Roman Babylon towers.&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;

The Citadel was an important fortification against medieval Crusaders, and centuries of rulers lived, worshipped and developed war strategy from within the walls of the Citadel. The CItadel is home to Gawhara Palace, the Mosque of Mohamed Ali, Mosque of Suleiman Pasha El Khadim, Mosque of El Nasser Mohamed and several small museums.&#60;/p&#62;

Several other tombs, pyramids and burial sites are in Saqqara, including The Serapeum, Pyramid of Teti, Mastaba of Mereruka and Mastaba of Ti. New Kingdom tombs dating from 1550 to 1070 B.C.E. are still under archaeological excavation in Saqqara, and the mortuary temple near the Unas Pyramid complex dates back to 2353 to 2323 B.C.E.

You&#38;rsquo;ll also see the Great Pyramid of Cheops, built for Pharaoh Khufu; the Pyramid of Chefren, built for Khufu&#38;rsquo;s son, Pharaoh Khafre, and Pyramid of Mycerinus, built for Pharaoh Menkaure.

Here, you&#38;rsquo;ll find the shining, gold-capped domes of Cathedral of the Dormition and the somber-looking State Kremlin Palace. There are four cathedrals in the complex, including the Cathedral of the Annunciation, which is now a fascinating museum. The Cathedral of the Archangel, the burial site of several medieval leaders, is also within the citadel area. Many of the Kremlin Citadel walls and towers erected in the late 15th century still surround the complex and offer hours of captivating exploration. In spite of the tremendous number of Kremlin squares, cathedrals, churches, towers, palaces and museums open to the public, it&#38;rsquo;s only a third of the entire citadel.&#60;/p&#62;

Lenin&#38;rsquo;s Mausoleum is on the square, as are the treasured Kazan Cathedral and the popular GUM department store. The square also bears the tribute statue to Minin and Pozharsky, the leaders of the 1612 militia that warded off Polish invaders.&#60;/p&#62;

In the 14th and 18th centuries, the area was a muster site to important Russian armies, and it became a summer home for the tsars and their families. It was also an instrumental site during the &#38;ldquo;Time of Troubles.&#38;rdquo; Today, the village is home to the 16th-century white stone Church of the Ascension, one of the first churches in the country to depart from Byzantine architecture. It also houses St. George the Victorious Bell Tower, the Hunting Pavilion and a 17th-century water tower. In all, there are 17 &#38;ldquo;architectural monuments&#38;rdquo; here, many of which were part of the 16th-century tsars&#38;rsquo; estates. Four historic wooden structures were moved from other areas of the country to the Kolomenskoye site.&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;

Spaces replicate living rooms, kitchens and bedrooms of East German apartments. These rooms are yours to roam, with &#38;ldquo;artifacts&#38;rdquo; tucked in drawers, closets and cupboards. Stasi surveillance bugs are tucked into unexpected places, and you can overhear a prisoner interrogation. You can even hop in a typical GDR-era Trabi car to travel through a mock East German housing development.&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;

Originally known for its address, Prinz-Albrecht-Stra&#38;szlig;e 8, it was also the site of a &#38;ldquo;house prison&#38;rdquo; where citizens were interrogated and tortured from 1933 to 1945. The museum explores how the Third Reich rose to power and how Nazi followers used fear and persecution to control the populace. Stories of individuals affected during the Nazi era are presented in moving and captivating ways. Topography of Terror is just one of many newer museums and historic sites opening to the public. With abundant deals &#60;strong&#62;available for business class flights to Berlin,&#60;/strong&#62; you can trek over here every few years to experience these new attractions.&#60;/p&#62;

The imposing building was created in the late 1800s to house the German Diet, or parliament. It was burned in 1933 and abandoned after the war. With German reunification, the gorgeous building was restored to its original purpose, with a few notable changes. Some historic artifacts were left in place during the site&#38;#39;s reconstruction, including World War II-era Soviet soldier graffiti. Also new to the historic building is a modern glass dome erected in place of the Reichstag&#38;rsquo;s destroyed cupola. Visitors can walk on the spiral ramps around the edge of the dome for stunning views of the city. Pre-registration is required, so schedule your visit at the same time you &#60;strong&#62;book your first class flight to Berlin.&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;

Now used only for state functions, the palace sits on the land once occupied by the Alc&#38;aacute;zar, built in the 9th century. The palace as you see it today was built in the early 18th century and contains more than 3,400 rooms in 1.4 million square feet of space. Since Spanish monarchs supplied many of the art collections on display at the Prado Museum, it&#38;rsquo;s not surprising that the palace is filled with works of the masters. The royal art collections includes more than 3,500 paintings, 276 wall paintings, 6,000-plus sculptures and 3,000 tapestries and textiles. Several notable gardens surround the palace, including the Sabatini Gardens and the Campo del Moro Gardens.&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;

In the latter half of the 20th century, while many elite South Africans enjoyed unfettered &#60;strong&#62;freedom and luxuries like first class flights&#60;/strong&#62;, anti-apartheid leaders were confined on Robben Island. Nelson Mandela was imprisoned here for 18 years, as were two other recent South African presidents and countless freedom fighters. Now a World Heritage Site, Robben Island offers tours of the prison site led by former political prisoners. Tours also pass by the island&#38;rsquo;s limestone and Bluestone quarries, a leper graveyard, Robert Sobukwe&#38;rsquo;s prison home and various military bunkers.

Its importance dates back to the 9th century, when markets, festivals, coronations and executions were held here. The iconic R&#38;ouml;mer, or city hall, buildings are medieval structures erected in the 15th to 18th centuries. These include the Old Town Hall and the Imperial Hall. Along the east side of the square, you&#38;rsquo;ll find Frankfurt&#38;rsquo;s traditional frame houses. The square was also the site of a 1933 National Socialist, or Nazi, book burning.

Its namesake comes from the gold-topped Mary&#38;rsquo;s Column erected in the center of the square in the 17th century. The column memorializes the conclusion of Swedish occupation. The square&#38;rsquo;s biggest draw, though, is its New City Hall, or Neues Rathaus. The 260-foot tall city hall features stunning Flemish Gothic architecture. Its Glockenspiel carillon is a favorite for travelers. The Glockenspiel features a two-story &#38;ldquo;show&#38;rdquo; reenacting the Cooper&#38;rsquo;s Dance with life-size figures.

While the masses tour Frauenkirche, be different. Head to the beautifully Baroque Asam Church once &#60;strong&#62;your business class flight lands&#60;/strong&#62;. The church was built in the early 18th century as a private church for the Asam brothers, both local artists. With its gilded Rococo details, Asam Church fits maximum adornment into a narrow space. What it lacks in width, though, the church makes up for with grand height and abundant art. The church&#38;rsquo;s facade features a carved wooden door topped by a statue of St. Johann Nepomuk. Inside, the towering chapel is filled with frescoes and ornately carved wood. Rococo confessionals line the entrance hall, and the high altar and niche have interesting sculptures. Most of the statues, frescoes and carvings in the church are the work of the Asam brothers themselves. Asam Church represents some of the most important examples of Late Baroque architecture and art.&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;

It&#38;rsquo;s a bit of a hike, but that just means that you&#38;rsquo;ll enjoy less competition for the view. If you&#38;rsquo;re not up to climbing the hill, you can also hop on an exciting funicular to the top of Montjuic. Whichever way you make your way up the mountain, once there you&#38;rsquo;ll enjoy incredible vistas. This hill has been central to many of Barcelona&#38;rsquo;s most important events in history. It was home to the 1929 International Exhibition and the 1992 Summer Olympics. You can see the Olympic Stadium, Palau Sant Jordi and the grand Montjuic Castle.

Stroll along these streets and you&#38;rsquo;ll soon encounter some of the area&#38;rsquo;s many street performers, musicians and artists.

In fact, the city is often ranked as one of the best beach cities in the world. If your return business class flight doesn&#38;rsquo;t leave much time for beachgoing, make your selection carefully. If your time is very limited, head to Saint Sebasti&#38;agrave; beach. It&#38;rsquo;s just minutes from Barcelona&#38;rsquo;s city center, and it&#38;rsquo;s close to shopping and the aquarium. If you want to be in the center of the hubbub, Barceloneta should be your choice. There are plenty of water sports to enjoy here, and the party atmosphere is irresistible. If you want privacy and a chance to return home without tan lines, Cala de L&#38;rsquo;Home Mort is an option. The clothing-optional beach has a few amenities in a small sheltered bay. For fine sand and lush, green surroundings, Mar Bella is a good choice. Many of these beaches are within an hour of the city and easily reachable by train.&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;

Located in the Braamfontein suburb, Constitution Hill&#38;#39;s large complex boasts historic fort prisons and the country&#38;rsquo;s constitutional court. It is also the site of the country&#38;rsquo;s Flame of Democracy. Once protecting the city from British invasion, the Old Fort later gained infamy as a political prison. Ths jail, becoming known as Number Four, housed prisoners such as Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela. A Women&#38;rsquo;s Gaol was also crowded with female dissidents and women from all walks of life. The entire complex chronicles South Africa&#38;rsquo;s troubled journey to democracy and freedom. Several guided tours give visitors a sense of what life was like for its prisoners. This is especially true of the Night Tour and the Time Travel Tour. The Time Travel Tour treats visitors as &#38;ldquo;prisoners,&#38;rdquo; giving them prison uniforms and assigning prison tasks. It&#38;rsquo;s not a tour that appeals to every visitor, but it offers an unconventional way to experience Johannesburg history. To travel back in time to pre-democratic Johannesburg, you have to first travel to the city. We recommend business class deals to O.R. Tambo International Airport.&#60;/p&#62;

Its iconic Romanesque towers are quintessential Zurich, a symbol of the city&#38;rsquo;s strength, resilience and history. The local folklore is that Charlemagne discovered the remains of the city&#38;rsquo;s original patrons on this site. To honor patron saints Felix and Regula, he ordered the construction of the church.&#38;nbsp;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    The towers date back to the late 15th century and are just a few of the church&#38;rsquo;s gorgeous features. Like Lindenhof Hill, Grossm&#38;uuml;nster has remained a constant in Zurich&#38;rsquo;s culture through the centuries. Most notably, the church&#38;rsquo;s leaders launched the Swiss-German Reformation in the early 16th century. While you&#38;rsquo;re at Grossm&#38;uuml;nster, here are some interesting things to see and do:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Climb the 187 steps to the tower peak,&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Visit the Reformation Museum and&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Admire the Sigmar Polke stained glass windows.&#60;/li&#62;

While there are many other things to do in Beijing, take a day to head out to the wall&#38;rsquo;s Juyong Pass area. It&#38;rsquo;s one of the wall&#38;rsquo;s three most famous passes, partly because of its exquisite towers and structures. Originally a military fortification, the site dates back to the Spring and Autumn Period and was the first of the wall&#38;rsquo;s three major passes.&#60;br /&#62;
    Perhaps the most famous part of the pass is the 14th-century Cloud Platform gate. Standing more than 30 feet tall and constructed with white marble, the gate was dazzling. Although much of the structure was destroyed, the platform and many interesting elements remain. These sites include:&#60;br /&#62;
    - a watch post,&#60;br /&#62;
    - Buddhist carvings on the facades,&#60;br /&#62;
    - the arch&#38;rsquo;s inner roof adornments.&#60;br /&#62;
    The pass also offers some incredible views of the mountains and countryside. Plan to spend a day exploring the pass and the surrounding area so you don&#38;rsquo;t feel shortchanged.
