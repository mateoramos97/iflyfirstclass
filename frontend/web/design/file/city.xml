</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;h3&#62;Why Visit Amsterdam?&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Amsterdam is beautiful. Not just for her blue summer skies, beautiful tulips and gorgeous canals, the city exudes a beauty in the vibe that pervades her. The city of Vincent Van Gogh and capital of Holland is steeped in history and has a rich art and architectural heritage.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The Museum Square&#38;#8217;s Van Gogh Museum that displays hundreds of his works, the Anne Frank House where her original diary is still kept and the infamous coffeehouses that do not sell coffee are just some of the unmissable parts to see.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Almost 7,000 houses, churches, bridges, gables and miscellaneous parts of the city&#38;#8217;s structure dating back centuries are protected as part of her legacy. However, the city is far from old and dreary &#38;ndash; Amsterdam has one of the most vibrant and happening party scenes in all of Europe and people come from the world over to experience it.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Airports in Amsterdam&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The city of Amsterdam is served by a single airport - Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (AMS). Schiphol is the main international airport of the Netherlands. It is the third busiest in &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/continent/to-europe&#34; title=&#34;Business Class flights to Europe&#34;&#62;Europe&#60;/a&#62; and fifth busiest internationally for passenger traffic.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The former military airbase is located 5.6 miles (9 kilometers) from the main city itself, in the municipality of Haarlemmermeer.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;There are flights to close to 300 non-stop destinations that originate at AMS, serviced by almost 100 airlines.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Amsterdam Airport is designed to be more than just an airport - there is a collection of 1,200 books in the library, together with e-books and music that are available for free downloads; a museum of classical and contemporary art; and a permanent aviation exhibit.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Flight characteristics&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;There are numerous airline options to travel non-stop from the eastern United States to Amsterdam. Among the largest carriers that travel the route are:&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Delta Airlines;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Jet Airlines;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;KLM;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Lufthansa;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;United Airlines.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;All of them complete the journey in less than 8 hours but the shortest travel time is given by Delta Airlines and Jet Airways who arrive within 7 hours 20 minutes of departure.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;On the other hand, there are only two direct flight options from Los Angeles to AMS &#38;ndash; Delta and KLM. They both arrive 10 hours 20 minutes after departure.&#60;/p&#62;

With the thousands of dollars you&#38;#39;ll save on premium airfare, you&#38;#39;ll have plenty left over to experience all of the breathtaking activities in the City of Sails.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Auckland Beckons You With Unrivaled Adventures&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Ancient Maori traditions flavor Auckland&#38;#39;s big-city atmosphere, creating an inviting and embracing energy. Named Tāmaki Makaurau by native Maori, Auckland offers dozens of captivating activities, from guided volcano walking tours led by Maori descendants to rousing Maori welcome ceremonies filled with chants, songs and food. Maori art, haka (dance) and symbols are ever-present throughout the city and offer a fascinating glimpse into early New Zealand life.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Aside from its distinctive native traditions, Auckland is a thrill-seeker&#38;#39;s paradise, known for its creation of bungee jumping and other spectacular outdoor adventures. Perched on a narrow stretch of land between the Pacific Ocean&#38;#39;s Waitemata Harbor and the Tasman Sea&#38;#39;s Manukau Harbor, Auckland&#38;#39;s water views and recreation are tremendous. Surf the robust waves on the West Coast, paddle board on the calmer eastern water or sail around the harbors for a delightful day. Visitors looking for a few less thrills can lounge on the serene shores of Wattle Bay in Awhitu or relax on the Muriwai&#38;#39;s black-sand beach.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    With cliffs, caves, mountains and volcanic cone hills, Auckland&#38;#39;s terrain invites plenty of hiking, caving and rock climbing as well. Some of the region&#38;#39;s legendary activities combine all three activities, such as those found at the Waitomo Caves. Rappel down into the cavern, zip line across the dark abyss&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;and drop into the underground stream. As you float along the streams, you&#38;#39;ll gaze at thousands of glowworms illuminating the ceiling before climbing up the cave walls to emerge into the daylight.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Unsurprisingly, Auckland&#38;#39;s more traditional pursuits are just as compelling as its adventures.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Relish the Polynesian music, crafts and foods at Otara Flea Markets on Saturday mornings;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Pedal along the waterfront of Tamaki Drive or dine at a romantic restaurant in the Viaduct Harbour/Princes Wharf district;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Explore the old military tunnels in North Head;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Browse through the Maori exhibits at Auckland War Memorial Museum;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Savor the views and the food at the 1,076-foot Sky Tower&#38;#39;s revolving restaurant.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Whatever your pleasure, you&#38;#39;ll find it in magnificent Auckland.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Berlin is a Study in Triumph and Peace&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Once separated by the Cold War-era Berlin Wall, today&#38;#39;s unified Berlin abounds with robust industries, a world-leading economic center, appealing cultural activities and plentiful recreation. Sprawling Berlin&#38;#39;s history is gorgeously told through its many buildings, which bear the marks of each successive regime.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Many of the city&#38;#39;s most magnificent buildings are located in the Mitte area, offering a unique glimpse at the city&#38;#39;s history. Revel in the triumphant spirit felt at Brandenburg Gate, one of the city&#38;#39;s most iconic symbols of victory and reunification. Tour the fabulous cathedral Berliner Dom, known for its three domes and pleasing mix of Renaissance, Gothic and Baroque styles. Enjoy remarkable city views and a glimpse of parliament at the Reichstag building. The site of proclaimed German reunification in 1990, the Reichstag features a glass-enclosed dome with walkways all around.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Remnants of the Berlin Wall itself offer some of Berlin&#38;#39;s most captivating experiences. Stark and austere, the Berlin Wall Memorial honors Germans who died while trying to cross between East Berlin and West Berlin, and it gives visitors a sense of the hopelessness many locals felt in trying to connect with the forbidden &#38;quot;other side.&#38;quot; Checkpoint Charlie Museum, East Side Gallery and other fragments of the gate also offer interesting views of life before, during and after the city&#38;#39;s division.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;Fascinating museums fill the city, giving visitors a chance to explore history and life in Berlin. The Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe is a moving exploration of Nazi concentration camps, and the Stasi Museum presents the experience of living in East Berlin during Communist reign.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Other, more traditional museums are found on the enticing Museum Island, at the heart of the historic Mitte section.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;The Pergamon,&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Bode,&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Altes&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Neues museums&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;fill Museum Island with exhibits of Egyptian and Byzantine artifacts, fine German paintings, brilliant sculptures and prehistoric finds.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Aside from the city&#38;#39;s rich heritage sites, Berlin&#38;#39;s tranquil parks, exciting shopping centers and two compelling zoos create even more avenues of entertainment. Several theaters, opera houses, concert halls and sporting venues round out the city&#38;#39;s entertaining appeal.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Discover for Yourself Why Dubai is the Hot Travel Destination&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Broad, manicured streets are lined with sleek and impressive skyscrapers, evidence of Dubai&#38;#39;s superb economic vitality. Everything in Dubai is over-the-top. Its Burj Khalifa is the world&#38;#39;s tallest building, and its Palm Islands are the largest artificial islands in the world. The Burj al Arab, the only seven-star hotel on earth, perches on its own private island, a gleaming interpretation of a ship&#38;#39;s sail.&#60;br /&#62;
    As befits a city with so many elegant services, Dubai offers a bounty of upscale entertainment, recreation and lodging in a glittering tropical setting.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    In keeping with Dubai&#38;#39;s penchant for generously sized buildings, Dubai is home to some of the most immense shopping malls in the world. You&#38;#39;ll be awe-struck by the Dubai Mall, showcasing more than 1,000 shops, a 22-screen cinema, 160-plus food establishments, an aquarium and an ice rink. Take a break from shopping to enjoy the center&#38;#39;s largest dancing fountain in the world. The fountain projects 1.5 million lumens of light and water sprays up to 500 feet tall, all choreographed to classical, world and Arabic music.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Aside from all of Dubai&#38;#39;s glistening contemporary sites, the city also offers some captivating historic areas. Browse through local artifacts and exhibits at Dubai Museum. Marvel at the medieval Fatimid-style minarets and bright, white dome of Jumeirah Mosque, one of the largest mosques in the area.&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;Wander through the old souk marketplaces to shop for fine fabrics, local wares, gold and food.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Outside the city, explore Arabian history at the old Burj Nahar watchtower, built in the 19th century as one of three posts guarding the city. Revel in the traditions found at the Hatta Heritage Village in the Hajjar Mountains, about an hour outside Dubai. The traditional 16th century village features a mosque, a watchtower, a fort and houses made of stone, mud, palm tree trunks and reeds.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    True to its modern nature, Dubai also provides several thrilling theme parks, as well as fascinating nature reserves filled with flamingos, broad-billed sandpipers and other waterbirds.&#60;/p&#62;

</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;h3&#62;Why Visit Hong Kong?&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Hong Kong was ruled by the British for a century and handed back to China in 1997. This unique history made it a vibrant hub of East and West, and HK, as it is still popularly known, developed a distinctive character that merged the best of both worlds.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Because the tiny island is known for her iconic skyline and fast-paced life, most are surprised to discover that almost 70% of it is mountains and greenery. Still, the other 30% manages to squeeze in enough experiences that you might be forgiven for thinking it was much larger than it actually is.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The food is singularly good. This definition may be readily applied to fancy restaurants in chic hotels and unassuming noodle corners in the crowded markets. The hustle and bustle of the markets, and the treasures waiting to be uncovered inside, are a perennial draw for repeat visitors.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Airports in Hong Kong&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;There is only one commercial airport on Hong Kong island &#38;ndash; Hong Kong International Airport (HKG). It is also known locally as Chek Lap Kok Airport.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;It is the eighth-busiest airport in the world, with over 70 million passengers walking through its facilities in 2016. More than 100 airlines touch down here, with arrivals and departures from close to 200 destinations across the globe.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Flight characteristics&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;There is no shortage of direct flights from cities across the U.S.A. to Hong Kong. They are available from:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;San Francisco (SFO);&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Los Angeles (LAX);&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Seattle (SEA);&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Dallas (DFW);&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Chicago O&#38;#39;Hare (ORD);&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Newark Liberty (EWR);&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;New York (JFK);&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Boston (BOS).&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;All these flights travel northwards over Canada. The flight of the shortest duration is between Hong Kong and Seattle - Delta Air Lines takes 14 hours 10 minutes to complete the journey.&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Codesharig partners Cathay Pacific and American Airlines travel between Los Angeles&#38;#8217; LAX Airport and HK in 14 hours 50 minutes. The same two airlines travel between New York&#38;#8217;s JFK and Hong Kong in 15 hours 40 minutes.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;With Hong Kong being the best of East and West, her cuisine is, too. Experience full-course service at 30,000 feet, complete with exquisite wines and some of the most awarded in-flight service anywhere.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Relish the Grandeur of Moscow&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Over the course of the city&#38;#39;s 800-year history, Moscow has blended together a variety of cultures, traditions and sensibilities. Today, the city&#38;#39;s economy and industries exert significant influence on the world&#38;#39;s cultural, political and economic scenes. A result of the city&#38;#39;s success, it boasts more billionaires than any other city in the world and offers the upscale restaurants, stores and hotels to accommodate that wealth.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    At the heart of Moscow and one of it&#38;#39;s most iconic sites is Red Square. The square is anchored on one side by the stunning St. Basil&#38;#39;s Cathedral. The cathedral is known for its colorful and grand structures featuring magnificent turrets and bright red, green, blue and golden designs on onion-shaped domes. Also in Red Square, visitors can tour the State History Museum or pay homage to Vladimir Lenin and view his body in Lenin&#38;#39;s Mausoleum.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Next to Red Square is the breathtaking Kremlin complex, the official home of today&#38;#39;s Russian Federation president. In all, four cathedrals and five palaces are enveloped by the Kremlin&#38;#39;s 15th-century walls and towers. With gleaming golden domes, the Kremlin&#38;#39;s Dormition Cathedral served as the coronation&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;site for all of Russia&#38;#39;s tsars. While at the Kremlin complex, take time to admire the sights and sounds of the 266-foot tall Ivan the Great Bell Tower.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Other striking buildings in the city present fabulous examples of distinctive Russian architecture and reveal Russia&#38;#39;s varied past. Novodevichy Convent, Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, Tsaritsyno Park and the Triumphal Arch of Moscow are enchanting sites to explore.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    More contemporary buildings offer equally compelling destinations. The Seven Sisters, skyscrapers built during the Stalin era, create a distinctive skyline and mark the city&#38;#39;s modern renaissance. GUM and TSUM, Moscow&#38;#39;s extravagant malls near Red Square, offer upscale shops known for their high-end merchandise and their extraordinary surrounding architecture. End your exciting day in Moscow with a visit to some of the city&#38;#39;s trendy nightclubs or the new restaurants and open-air cinema at Gorky Park.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;For more than 800 years, the Marienplatz has been the heart of old Munich. Central to the Marienplatz is the ornate New Town Hall, bearing colorful flags, Gothic turrets and arches and numerous statues. Several times each day, visitors delight in the New Town Hall&#38;#39;s famed Glockenspiel, a reenactment of historical Bavarian events using 32 life-sized figures. Marienplatz also holds Mary&#38;#39;s Column topped by a gilded Virgin Mary; the medieval city&#38;#39;s gates of Isartor, Sendlinger Tor and Karlstor and the magnificent Frauenkirche. Immediately recognizable for its vibrant red roof and two dome-topped towers, Frauenkirche is one of Munich&#38;#39;s most revered sites.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Dozens of other historic buildings and churches are within blocks of Munich&#38;#39;s Marienplatz.

Marvel at the domed Theatine Church of St. Cajetan and the rococo design details of St. Anna of Lehel. The Maximilianeum is a Renaissance beauty sitting at the eastern end of the royal avenue, Maximilianstrasse. Admire the Siegestor triumphal arch and revel in the glory presented in the Statue of the Bavaria. Soak in the history and valor at the Feldherrnhalle, where statues of military leaders preside over the&#38;#160;area. While there, walk in the steps of Bavarian State Police where they confronted Adolph Hitler&#38;#39;s leaders in 1923.&#60;/p&#62;

Journey to the awe-inspiring sights and flavors of Osaka with IFlyFirstClass&#38;#39; &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/service/first-class-specials&#34;&#62;discount first class fares&#60;/a&#62; and business class tickets.

    &#60;h3&#62;Osaka Is the Ultimate Japanese Playground&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The bustling metropolis of Osaka is both avant-garde and historic, home to shining Umeda Sky Building&#38;#39;s twin towers looming 567 feet above the city. In a powerful display, the towers are connected by a rooftop bridge and Floating Garden, the ideal spot for gazing at the beautiful city.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Economically robust, the city houses a thriving electronics industry, with Panasonic, Sharp and Sanyo making their headquarters in Osaka. Additional modern marvels are showcased in the city&#38;#39;s Dotonbori Bridge district. Home to a giant mechanical crab, the entertainment district teems with colorful and frenetic electronic signs resembling the vivid video displays found in New York City&#38;#39;s Times Square. Restaurants, nightclubs and shops fill the area, making it an ideal place to conclude a day of sightseeing, traveling and working.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    A shining glass maritime museum, metal-domed sports arena and a state-of-the-art aquarium are just a few of the city&#38;#39;s modern attractions. Theme parks and activity parks abound here, with Universal Studios Japan, port-side Tempozan Ferris Wheel, Tennōji Zoo and the HEP Five amusement/shopping center.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    &#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;In spite of its cosmopolitan features, Osaka maintains vestiges of its traditions and history. Once Japan&#38;#39;s leading rice-trading post during the Edo Period, Osaka is known as &#38;quot;The Nation&#38;#39;s Kitchen.&#38;quot; Although rice-trading dominance is a distant memory, the city retains its world class culinary scene. Countless casual and fine dining restaurants and street vendors line the streets, offering plentiful spots to refresh and refuel during a day of traipsing around the city.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Historic sites provide insight into ancient lifestyles in Osaka. The city&#38;#39;s Sumiyoshi Grand Shrine is one of the oldest Shinto shrines in Japan, established in 211 by Tamomi no Sukune. Its bowed red bridge and grand gate entrances lead to beautifully constructed halls and exquisitely manicured gardens. Explore old Edo-period farmhouses at the unique open-air museum in Ryokuchi park, or wander through the reproduction of the majestic 16th century Osaka Castle.&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Modern Amenities Collide with Traditional Beauty in Appealing Seoul&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;With more than 25 million people in its metropolitan area, a massive population isn&#38;#39;t Seoul&#38;#39;s only extreme feature. The buzzing city is home to the largest theme park, the largest cinema screen, the most visited national park and the longest bridge fountain in the world. Globally known as a center of technology, Seoul brims with other attractions, including a deeply historical center, thriving art and culinary scenes and exciting shopping and recreation.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    The heart of Seoul is at historic Gyeongbokung Palace, the 14th century Joseon Dynasty royal seat. As the city was constructed around the palace, Gyeongbokung maintains its central role in Korean life, bearing the marks of hundreds of years of historical events, including bullet holes from the Korean Ware. Although Gyeongbokung is the most famous of the Five Grand Palaces, the other four palaces are nearby and worth a visit.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;

    Entertainment in bustling Seoul is vast, from the &#38;quot;indie&#38;quot; rock bands, nightclubs and street performers in lively Hongdae to the glittering neon scene found in Gangnam. Massive Lotte World offers the world&#38;#39;s largest indoor theme park, an outdoor amusement park, the country&#38;#39;s largest ice-skating rink, hundreds of shops and abundant restaurants, theaters and sports facilities.&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;h3&#62;Why Visit Bangkok?&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The capital of &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/country/to-thailand&#34; title=&#34;First Class flights to Thailand&#34;&#62;Thailand&#60;/a&#62; used to be one of the world&#38;#8217;s busiest tourism destinations. At the end of 2016, it was declared the world&#38;#8217;s busiest, beating out all competition from London to Paris to Dubai to Singapore.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;There was a slight dip in numbers at the end of 2015 after Islamist terrorists bombed one of the most revered temples in the country, the Erawan shrine. However, the Thai government&#38;#8217;s swift response has managed to reassure the country and the world that Thailand is a safe and exciting place to be.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Close to 33 million visitors visited the city taking in the wonderful vistas of golden Buddhist temples, gawking at the wares in the floating markets and night stalls, meandering through the throngs in the bar district and grimacing through thoroughly refreshing vigorous massages.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Airports in Bangkok&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;There are two airports in the city of Bangkok:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Don Muang Airport (DMK);&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Suvarnabhumi International Airport (BKK).&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The two airports are approximately 30 miles (48 kilometers) apart. A free shuttle service operates between the two.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Suvarnabhumi, which means &#38;#39;Golden Land&#38;#8217;, is the airport where most international flights, particularly those from the United States and Europe, land. About 120 airlines land and take off from here.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Besides ample private taxis and buses, BKK is also serviced by the custom-built Airport Rail Link (ARL) express commuter rail train. The &#38;#39;Sky Lane&#38;#8217;, an exclusive bicycle-only roadway runs along the perimeter without any traffic lights and intersections.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;There are no direct flights between the US west coast and Bangkok. A number of airlines like Air Canada, Qatar Airways and Malaysia Airlines operate single-stop routes and the flight duration is close to an entire day.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The fastest option is the Thai Airways - Cathay Pacific collaboration that will take you from LAX in Los Angeles to Bangkok&#38;#8217;s BKK in 18 hours and 30 minutes.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Cathay Pacific and Air China operate the quickest flights from the eastern U.S. seaboard to Bangkok &#38;ndash; 19 hours and 50 minutes with one stop departing from New York&#38;#8217;s JFK Airport.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Thai Airways is the best option if you want to discover the legendary hospitality of the Thai people and their wondrous food. From the first &#38;#39;Sawadeekhap&#38;#8217; at the door to the hot pad-thai or crispy noodles served with a refreshing wine of your choice, it is the perfect entr&#38;eacute;e for your Bangkok jaunt.&#60;/p&#62;

</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;h3&#62;Why Visit Shanghai?&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Shanghai is the business hub of the economic powerhouse that is China. It is recognized as both the nation&#38;#39;s largest and its richest city. It is a shopper&#38;#8217;s paradise for its streets full of hidden gems and also its elite shopping areas which offer a wide selection of the world&#38;#39;s most luxurious products.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/country/to-china&#34; title=&#34;Business Class flights to China&#34;&#62;China&#60;/a&#62; has embraced western capitalism very well, and that fact is most obvious in the attitude of this city&#38;#39;s youth. The nightlife in Shanghai is dynamic and diverse, a mixture of Eastern heritage and Western carefree attitudes. Apart from the majestic skyscrapers and futuristic buildings, there are also ancient temples and palaces to explore, creating a delectable mix of exciting experiences for any traveler.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Airports in Shanghai&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;There are two international civil airports in Shanghai:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Shanghai Pudong International Airport (IATA: PVG, ICAO: ZSPD) &#38;ndash; this is Shanghai&#38;#8217;s main international airport and is served by over 100 local and international airlines flying to and from more than 200 destinations worldwide.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport (IATA: SHA, ICAO: ZSSS) &#38;ndash; this is the city&#38;#8217;s secondary international airport. It is served mainly by domestic carriers and regional airlines flying international routes.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Flight characteristics&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The fastest direct flight from New York&#38;#8217;s JFK Airport to Shanghai&#38;#8217;s PVG is the 15 hours taken by China Eastern Airlines. The same airline also flies to SHA airport &#38;ndash; that flight also takes 15 hours.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;For the west coast of the U.S., the shortest direct flights to Shanghai are by United Airlines, Air China and Delta Air Lines. They all takes 14 hours to fly from Los Angeles LAX to Shanghai PVG. Jet Blue flies from Boston (BOS) to PVG in 15 hours 20 minutes.&#60;/p&#62;

</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;h3&#62;Why Visit Rome?&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;It is probably a truism that any city whose immortality has been assured through its appearance in countless novels, plays, photos and films is worth a visit. Rome, the Eternal City, is the perfect example.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Its 3,000-year-old history is replete with great deeds and great monuments. Many of the latter still stand today, making Rome a place of enigmatic attraction for anyone with even a passing interest in history.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The great Colosseum is one of its greatest attraction. It is amazing to contemplate that this structure that stands today was built almost two millennia ago, and at that time seated almost 60,000 people. Fine art always found a home in Rome &#38;ndash; what would be ordinary walkways and unremarkable squares in most other cities are major tourist attractions featuring masterpiece sculpture by some of the greatest artists that the world has ever known in this city.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Airports in Rome&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Rome is served by three airports:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Leonardo da Vinci International Airport (FCO) - this is Italy&#38;#8217;s main international airport, located 21.7 miles (35 kilometers)) from the city itself. It is one of Europe&#38;#8217;s busiest airports, and saw almost 42 million passengers in 2016. The national airline, Alitalia, is based here.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Ciampino&#38;ndash;G. B. Pastine International Airport (CIA) &#38;ndash; Located 7.5 miles (12 kilometers) outside Rome, this is the city&#38;#8217;s secondary international airport. It is used mainly by low-cost airlines serving the region.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Rome Urbe Airport &#38;ndash; This is a civilian airport 4.3 miles (6.9 kilometers) from the city itself.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Rome has an efficient pubic transport system served by buses and trains which offer a cheap alternative to taxis to and from the airports. Unsurprisingly, Leonardo da Vinci International Airport is the most well-connected.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Flight characteristics&#38;#160;&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;You are spoiled for choice if you are travelling from the American east coast to Rome. Many premium airlines offer a direct flight, and all of them arrive at their destination between 8 hours 35 minutes and 9 hours:&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Air France;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Alitalia;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;American Airlines;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;British Airways;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Delta;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Finnair;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;KLM;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Lufthansa;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;United.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;There are no non-stop flights between the eastern coast of the United States and Rome. Norwegian Air operates a single-stop flight between LAX and FCO which has a brief layover at Oslo. This flight has a duration of 16 hours 30 minutes.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;With Rome being an international tourist destination and major business hub, the service, entertainment and dining on board first class flights to Rome are impeccable. Premium class passengers are also given access to lounges before they board the plane.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/airline/air-france&#34; title=&#34;Business class fares with Air France&#34;&#62;Air France&#60;/a&#62; provides a particularly nice collection of wines and cognac. The multi-course meal is accompanied with separate servings of soup, salad, caviar and cheese.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Why buy tickets with I Fly First Class?&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Buying first class and &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/service/one-way-business-class-tickets&#34;&#62;business class tickets&#60;/a&#62; does not have to be as expensive as it seems.&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;The Crossroads of Natural and Man-made Wonders&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;With gorgeous natural features, fascinating historic sites and lively nightlife and cultural scenes, even jaded travelers get a thrill when traveling to Sydney. The city captivates visitors with its natural beauty, from Sydney Harbour and Darling Harbour to the Pacific Ocean and countless beaches.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    These breathtaking sights also offer exciting activities.

Ride the exuberant waves at Manly, Bondi and Coogee beaches; kayak in Sydney Harbour or watch for wallabies and kangaroos in Royal National Park.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Just to the west of the city, even more natural thrills await in the Blue Mountains and beyond.

Nearby Jenolan Caves offer additional adventures, with underground rivers and miraculous formations just waiting to be explored.&#60;br /&#62;

</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;h3&#62;Why Visit Paris?&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Paris is regarded as one of the world&#38;#8217;s greatest cities; a chic, metropolitan nexus of new and old. It has been one of the most prominent cities in the arts for centuries and been a home and favorite getaway to accomplished individuals in every field.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Parisian culture is the epitome of what it means to be French &#38;ndash; good food, good wine, good cheese and a relaxed atmosphere within which to enjoy them all. The sights of Paris like the Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe and Champs-&#38;Eacute;lys&#38;eacute;es are among the most recognizable anywhere, imprinted in our collective consciousness as symbols of a city we all want to visit someday.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Airports in Paris&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Paris is served by five separate airports of varying size. They are:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Charles de Gaulle Airport, the country&#38;#8217;s main airport and ninth-busiest in the world;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Orly Airport &#38;ndash; France&#38;#8217;s second largest airport and a major hub for both international and domestic flights;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Beauvais-Till&#38;eacute; Airport &#38;ndash; Formerly known as the Paris-Beauvais Airport, it is 1 hour from Paris and is served by several charter and low-cost airlines;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Paris&#38;ndash;Le Bourget Airport &#38;ndash; The home of the Paris Air Show also serves as a hub for business jet traffic through the rest of the year;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Ch&#38;acirc;lons Vatry Airport &#38;ndash; Approximately 90 minutes from Paris, this airport is served by regional and budget airlines.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Flight characteristics&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Some of the world&#38;#39;s biggest airlines fly directly from the United States to Paris. Among them are:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Air France;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;American Airlines;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;British Airways;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Delta;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/airline/united&#34;&#62;United&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The Atlantic crossing is made non-stop from the western seaboard of the United States only by Air France. The duration of this flight between Los Angeles LAX and Charles de Gaulle Airport is 10 hours and 40 minutes.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Many airlines travel from the eastern seaboard to Paris and this subtracts about five hours from the journey.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;With Paris being a major world city, flights from other big international cities like New York and Los Angeles offer premium comfort seating, excellent in-flight entertainment and varied dining options created by acclaimed chefs.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The flight is an excellent opportunity for an introduction to French cuisine to discover why it has such a remarkable reputation. Air France is renowned for its self-service in-flight buffet on this sector.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Premium airlines offer a selection of complimentary alcoholic drinks and non-alcoholic drinks, as well as snacking options throughout the flight.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Why buy tickets with I Fly First Class?&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Sitting on a flight for over ten hours, unless it is first class or business class can be a challenge for most people. However, the cost of first class and business class tickets can be a deterrent for them.&#60;/p&#62;

</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;h3&#62;Why Visit Tokyo?&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The capital of the Land of the Rising Sun is one of the most advanced, most modern and most energetic cities in the world. It has long been a center of innovation, creativity and entertainment across a wide range of genres.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The Japanese people are known the world over for their devotion to tradition and honor, a rare trait in a society as modern and advanced. It is for that reason that the Japanese devotion to cleanliness, punctuality and courtesy is especially apparent in Tokyo.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Aside from modern skyscrapers that seem to touch the clouds, Tokyo also has its share of natural wonders. The sights of the world-famous spring cherry blossoms and the Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden are a must-see.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Japanese food is loved all over the world and Tokyo does it best with more Michelin stars than any other city anywhere.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Airports in Tokyo&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Tokyo is served by two international airports:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Narita &#38;ndash; the main international airport, catering primarily to flights to and from North America and Europe.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Haneda &#38;ndash; international flights mainly to and from the Pacific and Asian countries; also some from other parts of the world.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Narita is slightly further from the center of Tokyo than Haneda; however, it is better connected by roads, rail and public transport to other parts of the prefecture. Haneda would be a preferable choice if you are planning on catching a domestic flight.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Both airports are world-class and provide an excellent list of amenities for travelers.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Flight characteristics&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;A number of airlines ply the popular Los Angeles to Tokyo route with direct flights. The typical duration of the flights is between 11 hours 40 minutes and 12 hours 5 minutes. There is only a single non-stop flight between Los Angeles&#38;#8217; LAX Airport and Tokyo&#38;#8217;s Haneda Airport. This route is run by &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/airline/united&#34;&#62;United Airlines&#60;/a&#62; and takes exactly 12 hours.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;On the other hand, several airlines fly between LAX and Narita, among them are Air Canada and Alaska Airlines. The flight durations vary between 11 hours 40 minutes and 12 hours 5 minutes.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;There are currently no direct flights between the east coast and Haneda Airport while several airlines do fly from New York&#38;#8217;s JFK to Narita. The fastest of these is run the US Airways and takes 13 hours 55 minutes.&#60;/p&#62;

</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;h3&#62;Why Visit London?&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Whatever your passion or vocation, London is a prime destination. Here, you can immerse yourself in grand architecture and history at sites like Buckingham Palace, St. Paul&#38;#8217;s Cathedral and Westminster Abbey and other top-rated attractions in England. If you have a fervor for science, London delights with Greenwich&#38;#8217;s Royal Observatory, the Science Museum and the Museum at the Royal Institution. This world-class city is also known for its spectacular film and theatrical venues, from studios producing Harry Potter films to the West End&#38;#8217;s magnificent live productions. For business travelers, London presents a wide array of opportunities. In The City, also known as The Square Mile, entrepreneurs, bankers, insurance executives and finance wizards find many of the world&#38;#8217;s largest financial enterprises. London also boasts a thriving tech start-up scene, renowned fashion and creative industries and a robust manufacturing sector. Of course, London is fun too. With popular attractions like the London Eye, the London Dungeon and Piccadilly Circus and a rousing nightlife, the city is a never-fading kaleidoscope of entertainment.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;London Airports&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Blessed with six excellent international airports, London is one of the world&#38;#8217;s most traveled global destinations.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Heathrow Airport, just 20 miles west of Central London, is the country&#38;#8217;s busiest airport. Traveling from Heathrow to London&#38;#39;s city center is a quick, 15-minute ride aboard Heathrow Connect and Heathrow Express trains. An on-site Tube station and countless hotel and tourist shuttles make transit between the airport and the city convenient too.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Gatwick Airport is another traveler favorite, treasured for its efficiency, proximity to London and 200 flight destinations.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Stansted Airport is 40 miles northeast of London, especially known for its abundant flights to and from European destinations. For prime location, it&#38;#8217;s tough to beat London City Airport. It&#38;#8217;s three miles from Canary Wharf and six miles from Central London, and it serves many flights from New York.&#60;/li&#62;

</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;h3&#62;Why Visit Frankfurt?&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;In a &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/continent/to-europe&#34; title=&#34;first class fares to Europe&#34;&#62;Europe&#60;/a&#62; that is increasingly multi-cultural and a melting pot of societies from around the world, there are few major cities that have as distinctly an &#38;lsquo;original&#38;#8217; atmosphere today as they did in the past as the German city of Frankfurt.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Less touristy than most other major German cities, Frankfurt is a great introduction to German heritage and culture as it has been enjoyed for centuries. Food and drink are an essential part of the experience &#38;ndash; the local apple wine &#38;ndash; or Apfelwein &#38;ndash; is the nectar of choice. Frankfurt has given its name to the frankfurter and the bratwurst sausage should not be missed.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Frankfurt&#38;#8217;s architecture is marvelous &#38;ndash; the Romerberg square, Church of St Paul and Museum of Modern Art and Museum of Natural History are world-class tourist attractions.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Airports in Frankfurt&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;There is only one international airport in Frankfurt - Frankfurt International Airport (FRA). Some confusion has arisen because of the name of another airport, the Frankfurt-Hahn Airport (HHN). HHN is actually not in the vicinity of Frankfurt city &#38;ndash; it is 130 kilometers to the southwest - and should not be confused with FRA.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Frankfurt International Airport is serviced by over 100 airlines which fly to almost 300 destinations in more than 110 countries. It handles over 50 million passengers annually. The airport is well connected by road and rail to the city of Frankfurt and the rest of the country.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Flight characteristics&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;There are several flights from the United States that fly directly to Frankfurt. From the eastern seaboard, there are at least three choices:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Lufthansa;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Singapore Airlines;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Delta Air Lines.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;Lufthansa takes the shortest time, completing the journey in just 7 hours 25 minutes. From the west of the United States, there are at least two non-stop flights to Frankfurt. Both are operated by Lufthansa.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The airline takes 10 hours 55 minutes to travel from LAX in Los Angeles to Frankfurt Airport. It takes 13 hours 42 minutes to travel between San Francisco (SFO) and Frankfurt&#38;#8217;s FRA.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Johannesburg is a Compelling City in the South African Savannah&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Johannesburg&#38;#39;s energetic central business district offers everything you expect from a modern city. Entrancing museums, colorful art galleries, lively shopping and rousing theaters keep Johannesburg visitors busy day and night. Fantastic views of the city and beyond are found on the 50th floor observation deck of Africa&#38;#39;s tallest building, the Carlton Centre in the southeast section of the central business district.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Johannesburg&#38;#39;s cultural attractions are bountiful, from the Apartheid Museum to Museum Africa. The country&#38;#39;s troubled period of apartheid and the resulting movement for equality and freedom are movingly explored in the Apartheid Museum&#38;#39;s 22 exhibition areas. More compelling exhibits and sites relating to South African history are found at the Hector Museum and Constitution Hill. The hill is home to the Old Fort Prison Complex, the site of incarceration of Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela and other political activists prior to South Africa&#38;#39;s 1994 democratic conversion. The Nelson Mandela Museum is in nearby Soweto.&#60;br /&#62;

    &#60;br /&#62;
    Like many metropolitan cities, sprawling and tree-filled Johannesburg also has many suburbs. Surprisingly, though, Johannesburg&#38;#39;s suburbs have their own notable architecture. Immense Sentech Tower, an iconic symbol of Johannesburg, is actually located in Brixton, while equally immense Hillbrow Tower is in the suburb of Hillbrow.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;

    &#60;br /&#62;
    With a nod to more contemporary needs, Alstadt also features a broad river promenade, ideal for skating, jogging and strolling. The &#38;quot;longest bar in the world,&#38;quot; a collection of more than 300 bars and discos, runs alongside the promenade, making it a lively, bustling spot in the evening.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Terrific Humor, Talented Artists and Towering Buildings Add to Brussels&#38;#39; Delight&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Bi-lingual Brussels is a captivating melting pot of languages, tradition and architecture, appealing to pleasure and business travelers alike. As evidence of its metropolitan appeal, the city&#38;#39;s Northern Quarter swells with high-rise towers, teeming streets and countless business opportunities.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Away from the skyscrapers, though, Brussels is distinctively historic and artistic. Art and humor are beautifully combined in Brussels&#38;#39; famous 14th century Manneken Pis fountain. The fountain is topped by a statue of a little boy spraying water into the fountain. The statue is routinely dressed in elaborate costumes to add to the fountain&#38;#39;s mischievous appeal. Hundreds of years after its original creation in 1388, Manneken Pis was given a female counterpart in Jeanneke Pis, located in Fidelity Alley.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    More imposing artistry is found in Brussels&#38;#39; medieval Grand Place (Grote Markt). The Grand Place abounds with fascinating structures, including the 15th century Town Hall, 17th century Guild Houses and Maison du Roi, where visitors can view Mannekin Pis&#38;#39; 750 costumes. Every two years, visitors are treated to a stunning floral carpet, made of a million vibrant begonias arranged in artistic designs.&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;On the city&#38;#39;s Treurenberg Hill, breathtaking vaulted barrel ceilings and fabulous stained glass windows lure visitors into the glorious Cathedral of Saints Michael and Gudula. Elsewhere in Brussels, visitors relish&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;the grandeur of the Basilica Sacre Coeur,&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;the 19th century Palace of Justice,&#60;/li&#62;

    &#60;li&#62;La Monnaie Opera House.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
    Numerous museums in and around the city encourage visitors to explore the city&#38;#39;s culture, history, art and music. Other cultural delights keep visitors touring the city&#38;#39;s many neighborhoods, from reveling in the views from the top of the futuristic Atomium and experiencing a traditional gueuze/lambic brewery to savoring delectable Belgian chocolates.&#60;/p&#62;

</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;h3&#62;Why Visit Singapore?&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The tiny Southeast Asian island nation of Singapore truly represents East meets West. Hardly more than a speck on the world map geographically, Singapore is a major international hub of trade, industry and tourism. Once notorious for draconian laws, it today takes a much more relaxed approach to public order. This shift in philosophy has been paired with a greater appreciation and promotion of the arts. However, it still takes law and order ever as seriously &#38;ndash; Singapore is the world&#38;#8217;s second-safest and fifth-cleanest city.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Its multi-ethnic and multi-religious society is its greatest strength. It is common to see Chinese and Hindus praying at each other&#38;#8217;s temples, and the local food is an eclectic mix of flavors and traditions from around the world.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Airports in Singapore&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;There is only one airport in Singapore &#38;ndash; the award-winning Changi Airport. Voted the best airport in the world for the fifth year running in 2017, Changi is also the sixth busiest international airport; a flight lands or departs here every 90 seconds.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Located on Singapore&#38;#8217;s eastern end, Changi Airport is spread across 5 square miles and is home to 140 cafes and restaurants as well as 360 retail stores. It is renowned for the extensive range of amenities it provides passengers. There are 3 plant gardens, a butterfly garden, 24-hour movie theaters, entertainment kiosks with Xbox consoles, art installations and even tours of Singapore if you are in transit &#38;ndash; all free of cost.&#60;/p&#62;

</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;United uses the Boeing 787 Dreamliner on this 8,446 mile route, which is the world&#38;#8217;s the longest flight for that plane.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Singapore Airlines uses the Airbus A350-900 to complete the journey which is the company&#38;#8217;s longest. It will commence two longer direct services from the United States - from Los Angeles in late 2017 and from New York in 2018 using the Boeing 777-300ER and the A350-900ULR respectively.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Go Outdoors and Experience Adventure in Brisbane&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Thriving and energetic, environmentally friendly and innovative, Brisbane is the ultimate pleasure destination. Central to the city is the Brisbane River, weaving through neighborhoods and creating a breathtaking backdrop to the city&#38;#39;s abundant skyscrapers and high-rise buildings. Visitors delight in cruising the river at night for a unique perspective on the illuminated skyline or relaxing on the South Bank&#38;#39;s man-made beach.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    With its convenient river access and proximity to Moreton Bay and the Great Dividing Range, Brisbane is an ideal spot for adventurers. Sail around Moreton Bay, kayak along the river, relish the forest canopy vistas from the nine suspension bridges of the Tree Top Walk or scale Kangaroo Point&#38;#39;s towering 20-million-year-old cliffs. Animal lovers delight in the chance to snuggle up with koalas and feed the kangaroos at the expansive Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary, and thrill-seekers savor the excitement of climbing up and rappelling down the 260-foot Story Bridge. For milder thrills, bicycle or roller blade along the city&#38;#39;s 12.5 mile Riverwalk paths.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    More traditional pursuits are found throughout the city in its numerous landmarks and historic sites.&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

This cosmopolitan city on the Pearl River Delta is the perfect Chinese destination with plenty of historical sites, glitzy modern accommodations and amazing recreation. From Baiyun Mountain and Tiantang Peak to the Pearl River and the South China Sea, the city abounds with natural wonders too. It&#38;#39;s easily accessible as China&#38;rsquo;s third largest city, offering a number of Guangzhou first class deals to Baiyun International Airport.
</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;h2&#62;Relish Guangzhou First Class Deals to Baiyun International&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
    Serving 100 destinations and handling direct flights to and from dozens of North American cities, Baiyun International is extremely convenient for travelers. It is just 17 miles from downtown Guangzhou, and it&#38;#8217;s the main hub for China Southern Airlines. Guangzhou first class deals are abundant. Nonstop service is available between the airport and North American cities such as Los Angeles and New York. One- and two-stop routes are available from Chicago, Houston, San Francisco and Vancouver.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    With its proximity to downtown Guangzhou, the airport is an excellent landing point. Getting to town from the airport is easy with a variety of ground transportation options. While taxis, shuttles and airport buses are plentiful, the city&#38;#8217;s relatively new subway/metro system is a popular choice. The Airport South Metro Station is accessed via the airport&#38;#8217;s lower level. Line 3 of the Metro takes passengers to downtown Guangzhou and most of the city&#38;#8217;s favorite landmarks. Some of these attractions near Line 3 include:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.cantontower.com/en/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;Canton Tower&#60;/a&#62;,&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Zhujiang Park,&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Guangdong Museum,&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Twin Towers and&#38;#160;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;South China Botanical Garden.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;A new Airport North metro station will soon provide additional train options into the city and its suburbs.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h2&#62;Guangzhou First Class Deals or Hong Kong Flights?&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
    While Guangzhou&#38;#8217;s international airport is one of China&#38;#8217;s most-traveled, nearby Hong Kong airport is also a good alternative. Hong Kong International Airport is only 70 miles from Guangzhou, and it&#38;#8217;s the world&#38;#8217;s eighth busiest airport.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    As a slightly busier airport than Guangzhou, Hong Kong travelers enjoy more route options when traveling to Guangzhou. Travelers can choose nonstop flights between Hong Kong and several North American cities, including New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. Flights with one or more stops are available from dozens of U.S. airports.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Once travelers reach Hong Kong, getting to Guangzhou is simple using China&#38;#8217;s Guangzhou-Hong Kong Train. Twelve trains run between the two cities daily. The trip currently takes about two hours, but the country&#38;#8217;s new high-speed trains are nearly complete. Beginning in 2018, these bullet trains will make the trip between Guangzhou and Hong Kong in about 45 minutes. High-speed trains will stop en route between the two cities in Shenzhen.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;h2&#62;Getting from the Airport to Yuexiu&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
    Many of the city&#38;#8217;s most treasured historical and cultural landmarks are located in Guangzhou&#38;#8217;s Yuexiu district. Yuexiu dates back to the city&#38;#8217;s origin in 214 C.E., and it&#38;#8217;s the birthplace of what Westerners consider Cantonese culture. Located in the heart of the city, ground transportation to and around the district is plentiful.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Yuexiu is also rich with hotels and resorts. If you booked Guangzhou first class deals, you&#38;#8217;ll likely head directly to Yuexiu from the airport. Airport shuttles constantly run the route between Yuexiu and the airport. Airport shuttle lines 2A, 2B and 4 are some of the most direct routes to the neighborhood from the airport. Shuttle buses run every 20 to 45 minutes.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Metro trains also offer convenient ground transportation from the airport to Yuexiu. Yuexiu covers much of Guangzhou&#38;#8217;s downtown, so Metro Line 3 again links the airport to major Yuexiu attractions. Some of these landmarks include:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Sacred Heart Cathedral,&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Temple of the Six Banyan Trees,&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Guangxiao Temple,&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;People&#38;#8217;s Park,&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Guangzhou Zoo,&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Nanyue Kingdom Palace site,&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Xianxian Mosque,&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Ersha Island,&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Martyrs&#38;#8217; Cemetery and&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Revolutionary History Museum.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;h2&#62;Fascinating Day Trips with Guangzhou First Class Deals&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
    Guangzhou is ideally located for day trips to interesting villages and attractions. While travelers could spend their entire holidays within Guangzhou, visiting outlying areas is enriching. Guangzhou first class deals lead the way to dozens of day-trip options, including:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Kaiping dialou, or watchtowers. A world heritage site, these watchtowers began construction throughout Kaiping County during the Ming dynasty. A little more than half of the original 3,000 watchtowers remain in Kaiping villages. The towers represent a captivating blend of Eastern and European architectural styles and offer a peek at late 19th- and early 20th-century South China. It takes about two hours to reach Kaiping villages from Guangzhou.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Hailing Island. Guangzhou and its surrounding villages were along the Silk Road, and travelers can explore the marine portion of the trade route on Hailing Island. The main attraction is the&#38;#160;&#60;a href=&#34;https://www.travelchinaguide.com/cityguides/guangdong/yangjiang/maritime-silk-road-museum.htm&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;Guangdong Maritime Silk Museum&#60;/a&#62;&#38;#160;and its 800-year-old sunken ship that traveled the Silk Route. To explore the ship, visitors view it through aquarium walls built around the vessel.&#60;/li&#62;

The beaches in and around Shenzhen are also legendary. Whether travelers want to enjoy the glamorous cosmopolitan life or a recreation-filled holiday, business class deals to Shenzhen satisfy.
</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;h2&#62;Business Class Deals to Shenzhen Bao&#38;#8217;an Airport&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
    Just 20 miles from the city center, Shenzhen Bao&#38;#8217;an International Airport is an especially convenient destination if your travels extend to other Chinese cities too. Drawn to the city&#38;#8217;s beaches and theme parks, domestic travelers often choose Bao&#38;#8217;an Airport as their gateway. The airport serves more than 150 domestic routes, and these offerings are often better business class deals than one would find to other nearby airports.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    The airport also offers direct transport between Shenzhen and 21 international cities, most of them in Asia. A few nonstop flights are available from non-Asian international airports, including:&#60;br /&#62;
    -Seattle,&#60;br /&#62;
    -Sydney,&#60;br /&#62;
    -Auckland and&#60;br /&#62;
    -Frankfurt.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Most North American flights to Shenzhen involve connecting flights in other Asian cities. Travelers should keep in mind that, because the airport predominantly serves domestic travel, signage is mostly in Chinese. It&#38;#8217;s always a good idea to have a language translating app ready on your mobile device.&#60;br /&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
    Shenzhen&#38;#8217;s airport is so close to the city center that getting from the airport to city attractions is easy and quick. The city&#38;#8217;s metro system is widely acclaimed, and travelers can access metro trains from the airport. Two metro lines are convenient to the airport.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Line 1 travels between the airport and downtown Shenzhen in less than an hour. Trains run along this line every two to four minutes. This line links travelers to abundant downtown hotels, shopping malls and restaurants as well as a number of popular attractions.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Along Line 1, travelers find a host of interesting and entertaining sites:&#60;br /&#62;

Travelers can walk from the terminal to Line 11&#38;#8217;s airport station in about three minutes.

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
    While most visitors appreciate the convenience and abundance of using local metro trains, Shenzhen offers other options for getting around town and outlying areas.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    -Regular and bullet trains connect Shenzhen with other major Asian cities including nearby Hong Kong and Guangzhou. Trains passing through Shenzhen&#38;#8217;s six stations also connect to more distant cities, including Shanghai, Beijing and Nanjing.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    -Ferries offer additional transport options in this waterway-rich region. The two major ferry terminals, Shekou Ferry Terminal and Fuyong Port, connect travelers to Macau, Hong Kong and Zhuhai. Shekou&#38;#8217;s Prince Bay Port also now offers luxury cruises to Ho Chi Minh City and Nha Trang.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    -Buses are excellent sources of travel within Shenzhen&#38;#8217;s borders and beyond. More than 900 routes ensure that passengers can access just about any spot in the city. Some of these buses are express routes, marked as K or E buses, for those who want to bypass minor stops.&#60;br /&#62;

    &#60;h2&#62;Connecting Business Class Deals to Shenzhen&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
    For travelers who want more extensive flight options, routes and business class deals to Shenzhen, nearby alternative airports are superb choices. Both Hong Kong and Guangzhou support busy international airports with numerous direct flights from international cities.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    -Hong Kong Airport is closest to Shenzhen, and there are multiple transit options linking Hong Kong to Shenzhen. These options include high-speed trains, ferries, conventional trains and buses. Travelers from North America will find plenty of flight flexibility when using Hong Kong&#38;#8217;s airport. North American nonstop routes to Hong Kong include Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Toronto and Vancouver.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    -Guangzhou&#38;#8217;s airport is also convenient to those traveling to Shenzhen with just 84 miles separating the two cities. Guangzhou operates dozens of direct routes to and from North American cities, giving travelers flight options that may not be available at Shenzhen Bao&#38;#8217;an Airport. Traveling from Guangzhou to Shenzhen is simple using the bullet and conventional trains. The high-speed train travels the route in about 35 minutes.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;

Known for its golden pagodas, countless waterways and Buddhist temples, Yangon is a one-of-a-kind experience mingling its aging colonial infrastructure with modern skyscrapers. Ultimately, the city is a place where you can still experience authentic Southeast Asia. It&#38;rsquo;s also a prime destination for its convenient international airport that offers many business class flights to Yangon.
</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;h2&#62;Enjoy Business Class Flights to Yangon International&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
    Just nine miles from the city center, Yangon International Airport is the most popular airport of entry to Myanmar. Travelers can easily find a number of first and business class flights to Yangon. Unfortunately, none of the flights are direct routes from North America. There are plenty of non-stop flights from other countries however.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Some of the most popular direct international routes link Yangon with:&#60;br /&#62;
    -Singapore&#38;#8217;s Changi Airport,&#60;br /&#62;
    -Doha&#38;#8217;s Hamad International Airport,&#60;br /&#62;
    -Seoul&#38;#8217;s Incheon International Airport,&#60;br /&#62;
    -China&#38;#8217;s Guangzhou International Airport,&#60;br /&#62;
    -Hong Kong International Airport,&#60;br /&#62;
    -Thailand&#38;#8217;s Bangkok International Airport.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Other international destinations served by Yangon International Airport include Kuala Lumpur, Chiang Mai, Beijing, Delhi, Tokyo, Taipei, Dubai, Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. North American travelers can get to Yangon International Airport with one- or two-stop flights through any of these airports.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    A number of international airlines known for their premium luxury services fly to Yangon International. Some of the top-rated airlines serving Yangon International Airport include:&#60;br /&#62;
    -ANA,&#60;br /&#62;
    -Emirates,&#60;br /&#62;
    -Qatar Airways,&#60;br /&#62;
    -Singapore Airlines and&#60;br /&#62;
    -Cathay Pacific&#38;#8217;s Cathay Dragon Airline.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    &#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    &#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h2&#62;Getting Around Town After Your Business Class Flights to Yangon&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
    Ground transportation from the airport is varied and often gives travelers the feeling of stepping back into an earlier, more rustic Asia.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    -Taking a taxi from the airport to your hotel is the most direct way to travel between the airport and your destination. Taxis here usually charge flat rates to specific destinations, and the cost is often relatively inexpensive.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    -For travelers who want to mix and mingle with locals, public buses are also an option. The nearest bus stop is about a mile away, and none of the bus routes are direct from the airport to the city center. If you want to reduce walking time to the bus stop, take a taxi to the nearest stop at Se Mai.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    -The local circular commuter train is also an option for ground transport. Its nearest train station is also about a mile from the airport. Riding the circular train is incredibly cheap. If you&#38;#8217;re traveling from the airport to downtown Yangon, you&#38;#8217;ll likely get on the train at the Pa Ywet Seiki Kone station. You&#38;#8217;ll travel through 11 stops and disembark in downtown Yangon, also known as Kyauktada Township in Yangon&#38;#8217;s Western District. This is not only a popular area for hotels, but it&#38;#8217;s also near the famed&#38;#160;&#60;a href=&#34;http://myanmartravelinformation.com/yangon-where-to-visit/sule-pagoda.html&#34;&#62;Sule Pagoda&#60;/a&#62;, the Zoological Gardens and Maha Bandula Park.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    The train travels at about 9 miles an hour, so those 11 stops can take a while to get through. Riding the entire three-hour loop of the circular railway is a popular way to see the city and its surrounding villages. It&#38;#8217;s also a terrific opportunity to see authentic local lifestyles.&#60;br /&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
    While business class flights to Yangon International Airport is the quickest, most direct way to access Yangon, other Asian airports may be good alternatives. This is especially true for travelers who want to visit other Southeast Asian destinations and want to immerse themselves in local flavor.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    -While Yangon, as Rangoon, was once the Burmese capital, the new Myanmar capital is in Naypyidaw. The international airport there is not quite as big as Yangon, but it&#38;#8217;s a good alternative for those who want to see both Yangon and Naypyidaw. The capital city&#38;#8217;s airport serves a few international routes, including Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur. The airport is rapidly expanding, and it will eventually outpace Yangon International Airport in the number of flights and passengers it handles. Getting from Naypyidaw to Yangon takes about 12 hours aboard the country&#38;#8217;s British colonial railway system.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    -Mandalay is about 400 miles from Yangon, but its international airport is a good alternative to Yangon&#38;#8217;s if you plan to visit northern Myanmar. The train ride from Mandalay to Yangon can be completed in 14 to 15 hours.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h2&#62;Sightseeing With Business Class Flights to Yangon&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
    While Yangon overflows with amazing sights like&#38;#160;&#60;a href=&#34;http://myanmartravelinformation.com/yangon-where-to-visit/botahtaung-pagoda.html&#34;&#62;Botataung Paya&#60;/a&#62;&#38;#160;and Inya Lake, there are other delights outside the city limits. After all, exploring the countryside is a great way to make good use of the time you invested in your business class flights to Yangon.&#60;br /&#62;
    -Dallah offers unforgettable experiences, beginning with the ferry ride to the village. Often, you&#38;#8217;re fellow ferry riders are vendors selling everything from tea to watermelon slices. Once in Dallah, the pagoda and markets are in interesting change of pace from Yangon. Local transportation scams are prevalent here, though, so always be aware of your surroundings and be prepared for very persistent street vendors.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    -From Dallah, it&#38;#8217;s a 40-minute taxi ride to Twante. There, you can explore the Shwesandaw Pagoda, learn about rice fields and discover the ins and outs of growing local betel nuts.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;

This historical reference is a beautiful counterpoint to more modern Vietnamese attractions. Located in Vietnam&#38;rsquo;s south, Ho Chi Minh City is lush and hectic, and it&#38;rsquo;s a great launching pad for touring the entire country. Whatever the reason for the journey, first class deals to Ho Chi Minh City always lead to memorable travels.
</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;h2&#62;Local Airport Provides Many First Class Deals to Ho Chi Minh City&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
    Luckily for international travelers, Ho Chi Minh City is served by Vietnam&#38;#8217;s busiest airport: Tan Son Nhat. Flights from North America to Tan Son Nhat Airport are available from several airlines. Companies offering this route include American, Air Canada, Japan Air and Korean Air and Cathay Pacific airlines. Popular routes include New York, Los Angeles, Houston, San Francisco and Washington D.C. These flights are not non-stop, however, and travelers can expect a layover in Hong Kong or Seoul.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Traveling to Vietnam requires some patience, even for visitors who travel via first class. Traffic around the airport can be congested, and wait times at the customs desk can be lengthy. Even so, there are many benefits of traveling to Ho Chi Minh City&#38;#8217;s popular airport.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;The airport is less than five miles from the city center.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Chauffeured car service to and from the airport is relatively inexpensive and takes 15 to 20 minutes. Private chauffeur service can be reserved ahead of time or coordinated at the airport.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Local buses serve the airport every 15 minutes, linking the airport to Ho Chi Minh City&#38;#8217;s busy&#38;#160;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.vietnam-guide.com/ho-chi-minh-city/pham-ngu-lao.htm&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;Pham Ngu Lao Street&#60;/a&#62;.

    &#60;h2&#62;First Class Deals to Ho Chi Minh City Via Alternate Airports&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
    With Ho Chi Minh&#38;#8217;s location at the southern tip of Vietnam, most other regional airports are a fair distance away. Even so, there are a number of alternatives to flying into Ho Chi Minh City. These options can be convenient if travelers plan to do more extensive treks of Southeast Asia.&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;The closest alternative international airport to Ho Chi Minh City is Cambodia&#38;#8217;s Phnom Penh. Flights between North America and Phnom Penh&#38;#8217;s airport are not direct. Direct bus service from Phnom Penh Airport to Ho Chi Minh City is available and takes about six hours. Some border scams exist, so travelers should research their bus operator carefully.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Da Nang Airport is located in the center of Vietnam, but it&#38;#8217;s more than 500 miles from Ho Chi Minh City. It&#38;#8217;s the third busiest airport in Vietnam and operates a bustling international terminal. While flights connect Da Nang with several North American cities, none of the flights are direct. While Da Nang isn&#38;#8217;t necessarily a better option, travelers may enjoy its variety of first class deals to Ho Chi Minh City via Da Nang.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Hanoi&#38;#8217;s Nội B&#38;agrave;i Airport is more than 1,000 miles from Ho Chi Minh City. As a result, it&#38;#8217;s usefulness as an alternative to Tan Son Nhat Airport is limited. Bus and train service is available from Nội B&#38;agrave;i Airport to Ho Chi Minh City. The trip takes 31 to 33 hours.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;

    Once in Ho Chi Minh City, visitors have a variety of ground transportation options. Public buses are rather easy to use and affordable, and they&#38;#8217;re a great way to mingle with locals. Ben Thanh bus station is convenient to most Ho Chi Minh City attractions.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Ben Thanh Market is the perfect spot for visitors to haggle with souvenir vendors and enjoy a variety of local dishes.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;The Fine Arts Museum is housed in a beautiful colonial mansion and boasts an excellent collection of Vietnamese art.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Saigon Skydeck-Bitexco Financial Tower is five blocks from the bus station. Ride the elevator up to the 48th floor for incredible panoramic views of the city. The building also houses a variety of shops, fine restaurants, casual eateries and theaters.

    While some travelers enjoy the daily bustle of local bus service for exploring a new city, others prefer more privacy. Local taxi and private car services are relatively inexpensive, abundant and convenient. They&#38;#39;re especially good options for travelers who want to explore the city&#38;#39;s suburbs and outlying areas. It&#38;#8217;s always a good idea to research taxi and private car services before booking however. Popular day trip options from Ho Chi Minh City include:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
    While Kyoto doesn&#38;#8217;t have its own international airport, the city is one of the most convenient cities in the world to visit. This convenience is partly due to its many nearby airport options. The bounty of airports adds a little extra decision-making to travel planning. Travelers will need to carefully weigh travel priorities to determine the best airport for their itinerary. Whether speed and proximity or budget and simplicity are most important, Kyoto-area airports satisfy all priorities.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Understanding the various airport options in the Kyoto area helps travelers make their destination choices. The city is close to five airports:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Kansai International Airport in Osaka;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Osaka International Airport;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Central Japan International Airport, or Chubu Centrair International Airport, near Nagoya;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Narita International Airport in Narita and&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Haneda International Airport in Tokyo.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
    Osaka is less than 30 miles from Kyoto, and the city is served by two major airports. This provides for a wide availability of Kyoto discounted business class tickets. Both Kansai International and Osaka International offer train service from the airport to Kyoto. Most international flights are handled out of Kansai International Airport though. Osaka International Airport, also called Itami Airport, handles most domestic flights. Here are a few benefits and drawbacks of using Kansai airport.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Kansai International Airport Pros &#38;amp; Cons:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;The airport offers several direct international flights. These routes are mostly limited to and from Los Angeles, San Francisco and Honolulu.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Train service to Kyoto from Kansai is convenient. Train service is available near the airport&#38;#8217;s arrivals lobby. The Haruka Limited Express train ride from the airport to Kyoto takes about an hour and 20 minutes.&#38;#160;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Limousine buses also provide ground transportation from the airport to Kyoto hotels. The bus ride takes just under two hours.&#60;/li&#62;

It&#38;#8217;s close to many Osaka and Itami attractions, including&#38;#160;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.japantimeline.jp/en/hyogo/itami_city/national_historic_site:_arioka_castle_ruins/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;Arioka Castle Ruins&#60;/a&#62;&#38;#160;and the Instant Ramen Museum.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Osaka International Airport Pros &#38;amp; Cons:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;International travelers will likely only use Osaka International if they first make a domestic stop. As a result, North American travelers won&#38;#8217;t find any direct flights to the airport from U.S. or Canadian airports.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Osaka International is about 30 miles closer to Kyoto than Kansai International.&#38;#160;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Train service from the airport to Kyoto is not direct and requires two train transfers. Even with the train changes, though, the entire journey takes about an hour and 15 minutes.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Limousine bus service is a convenient way to travel from the airport to Kyoto. Buses depart the airport every 20 minutes and complete the trip in an hour and a half.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h2&#62;Other Convenient Kyoto Discounted Business Class Tickets&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
    Kyoto is so centrally located that there are a number of other easy-to-use airports nearby.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Chubu Centrair International Airport is less than 100 miles from Kyoto. Train service between the two points takes about 90 minutes and involves one train change. Chubu is located in Ise Bay near Nagoya and serves only two U.S. destinations: Detroit and Honolulu.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Narita International Airport is probably the most convenient airport in terms of the number of U.S. destinations it serves. Travelers can find routes to and from a dozen U.S. cities, including Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, San Diego and Chicago. Several flights are available daily from Narita to Osaka-Itami International Airport for travelers heading to Kyoto. Train service is also available.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Haneda International Airport is known for its high-end flight options. Travelers will find many Kyoto discounted business class tickets and first class flight options to Haneda. The airport serves several U.S. destinations, including Milwaukee, San Francisco and New York. Haneda is also close to popular Tokyo attractions such as&#38;#160;Senso-ji Temple&#38;#160;and the Akihabara district. Continuing on to Kyoto from Haneda International is relatively easy by train. The fastest routes involve a transfer to a Shinkansen bullet train and take a little more than two hours.&#60;/li&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
    Lively and picturesque, the Charles Bridge lures visitors and locals alike to its gorgeous span. The bridge dates back to the 14th century, commissioned by King Charles IV. Hundreds cross its 2,000 foot length each day, many stopping only to enjoy the incredible view of the Vltava River. Others linger along its 16-arch span, admiring the 30 marvelous Baroque statues and engaging with dynamic street vendors. Three towers arise from the bridge, two on the west side and one on the east, Old Town side. Strolling along the bridge and admiring its towers and statues is an ideal way to work out the cobwebs from your business class flight to Prague.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Over the centuries, the bridge has been at the epicenter of Prague&#38;#8217;s challenging history.&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Severed heads were displayed on the bridge tower to discourage other Habsburg resisters in 1621.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Locals fought off invading Swede forces on the actual bridge in 1648.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Several floods have swept through the town and damaged many parts of the bridge and its statues.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    Travelers looking for vast green space or leisurely pursuits after a long business class flight to Prague find joy in Petř&#38;iacute;n Park. The park boasts lovely walking trails, inviting dining spots and excellent gardens. The park&#38;#8217;s biggest claim to fame is its lookout tower that is reminiscent of Paris&#38;#8217; Eiffel Tower. Visitors can climb to the top of the tower for awesome views of the city and Vltava River. A fun funicular ride up the hill makes access to the tower easy.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    The park delights with several other notable features.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;

    &#60;h2&#62;Old Jewish Cemetery Brings Prague&#38;#8217;s Community to Light&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;

Its graves span some of Prague&#38;#8217;s most compelling years, from the early 1400s to the late 1700s. During its heyday, the cemetery layered graves to make use of very limited space. As a result, visitors will find more than 12,000 tombstones in the cemetery and an elevated ground space.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Many of Europe&#38;#8217;s most important citizens, leaders and clerics were buried in the cemetery.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;David Gans was a noted astronomer, mathematician and historian, buried here in 1621.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Poet and rabbi Avigdor Kara owns the oldest burial site in the cemetery. Interred here in 1439, his elegy remains an important part of Yom Kippur services at Old-New Synagogue.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Mordecai Maisel, noted Prague ghetto philanthropist, was buried in the cemetery in 1601. The synagogue he built in Prague still bears his name.&#60;/li&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
    Vietnam teems with several enthralling museums, and its first-class Military History Museum is especially fascinating. The museum highlights the country&#38;#8217;s military struggles throughout its incredibly long history. Among the museum&#38;#8217;s interesting displays are exhibits showcasing the fight against French colonialism and the Indochina War.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    The museum&#38;#8217;s collection of artifacts from the US-Vietnamese conflict are also compelling.

    No first class flight to Hanoi is complete until you&#38;#8217;ve visited the pretty Văn Miếu - Quốc Tử Gi&#38;aacute;m temple. Sometimes referred to as the Temple of Literature, Văn Miếu - Quốc Tử Gi&#38;aacute;m dates back to 1070. It is the site of the country&#38;#8217;s very first university, and it overflows with historic and picturesque buildings.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;

    The city&#38;#8217;s devotion to Ho Chi Minh is apparent to travelers as soon as their their first class flights land. The deceased leader has attained almost cult-like acclaim for his role in reunifying the country. Travelers and locals can pay their respects to the venerable leader at the imposing Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum. It&#38;#8217;s poetically located in Ba Dinh Square, where the leader read the country&#38;#8217;s Declaration of Independence in 1945.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    2. Outside the mausoleum, visitors can view the leader&#38;#8217;s residential complex. Many of the rooms are kept exactly as he left them at his death in 1969. These Ho Chi Minh &#38;#8220;vestiges&#38;#8221; are part of the Presidential Palace complex.&#60;br /&#62;

    &#60;br /&#62;
    3. A captivating showcase of the leader&#38;#8217;s life is found next to the mausoleum at Ho Chi Minh Museum. The museum displays an interesting and unusual array of exhibits, particularly on the upper level.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h2&#62;Nuremberg Business Class Deals Via Munich&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
    All of the attractions of Nuremberg are also less than a two hour&#38;#39;s drive from Munich Airport. Nuremberg business class deals from North America will most likely make a connection in Munich Airport. That&#38;#8217;s often good news since Munich Airport offers hundreds of domestic and international routes and greater variety than Nuremberg. Those traveling from North America will find the greatest number of flight options from several large cities. Newark, Chicago&#38;#8217;s O&#38;#8217;Hare, Washington-Dulles and Toronto airports provide departures for about 1.1 million Munich travelers each year.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Once in Munich, getting to postcard-perfect Nuremberg is easy and option-filled. Of course, travelers can hop on a 40-minute flight to Nuremberg Airport, then take the train to the city center. There are several other convenient options too.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    1. Munich Airport to Nuremberg By Train. Travelers can hop on an S-bahn train at Munich Airport, traveling to Munich&#38;#8217;s Hauptbahnhof downtown station in 40 minutes. From there, travelers can catch an ICE train that takes about an hour-and-a-half to reach Nuremberg&#38;#8217;s city center. Regional trains are also available from the downtown Hauptbahnhof station in Munich, but they are slower.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    2. Munich Airport to Nuremberg by Bus. Direct bus routes from Munich Airport to Nuremberg often make the trip more quickly than local trains. Total travel time between the two points is about two hours.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    3. Munich Airport to Nuremberg by Car. The Autobahn offers a quick route to Nuremberg, first on A92. Travelers can take the A9 connection from A92, and A9 leads directly to Nuremberg. Total travel time is about 1.5 hours.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
    Once your Nuremberg business class flights have landed, narrowing down your itinerary can be tough. There are dozens of quaint Bavarian villages around Nuremberg, and each offers its own delights. One popular option is to take a day to travel south of Nuremberg.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    -Regensburg is about an hour southeast of Nuremberg, and it&#38;#8217;s one of the country&#38;#8217;s oldest towns. Established in 179 A.D., the city rests on the banks of the Danube River and sports several medieval structures.&#60;br /&#62;
    -Ingolstadt is directly en route from Nuremberg to Munich. Like Regensburg, Ingolstadt has a historic city center and charming buildings. It&#38;#8217;s also home to interesting Audi factory tours, a designer outlet mall and the Museum of Medical History.&#60;br /&#62;
    -Neuschwanstein Castle is an ambitious but rewarding day trip from Nuremberg. This hilltop castle is a three-hour drive from Nuremberg, but well worth the time. Ornate Hohenschwangau Castle is also nearby. Trains are also available for the trip but increase the travel time a bit.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h2&#62;Enjoy Lively Festivals with Nuremberg Business Class Deals&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
    All of Bavaria teems with beer gardens, breweries and Franconian wine houses, and Nuremberg is especially rich. Visitors can explore these refreshments throughout the year, but Nuremberg&#38;#8217;s festivals offer unique opportunities to sample the local flavors. Most of the festivals and events are held in Old Town&#38;#8217;s central square, giving visitors easy train access from the airport.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    -Nuremberg&#38;#8217;s Spring Festival celebrates in Luitpoldhain park, a quick subway ride from the airport. The park also hosts the city&#38;#8217;s free open-air concerts in July.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    -Bardentreffen World Music Festival is held in Nuremberg at the end of each July. It&#38;#39;s Germany&#38;#8217;s largest world music event, and all stages are within walking distance of the central square.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    -Christkindlesmarkt. Christmas markets warm up even the grumpiest Scrooges, and Nuremberg&#38;#8217;s market is one of the best. Held in Old Town&#38;#8217;s central square, the festivities spill over into inviting side streets and laneways. The market is the perfect opportunity to enjoy local foods, crafts, performances and Christmas spirit.&#60;/p&#62;

</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;h2&#62;First Class Tickets to Lucerne Via Zurich&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
    Lucerne doesn&#38;#8217;t offer its own international airport, so most first class tickets to Lucerne are actually flights to Zurich. Flying into Zurich is actually a bonus since travelers are able to see the countryside traveling from Zurich to Lucerne.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Zurich Airport is Switzerland&#38;#8217;s largest airport, so travelers enjoy a variety of route options and deals. Direct transatlantic flights to Zurich Airport are available from Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Montreal, San Francisco and Washington D.C. Many more one-stop flights are available from additional North American cities. These routes are serviced by American, Delta and SWISS airlines, offering deals on first class and last minute tickets.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    The trip from Zurich Airport to the heart of Lucerne is quick and easy.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    -To Lucerne By Train. Swiss Federal Railway trains run every hour from Zurich Airport to Lucerne and other central Swiss locales. The train ride takes a little more than an hour and is a pretty ride through rural Switzerland.&#60;br /&#62;
    -To Lucerne By Car. The drive from Zurich to Lucerne is picturesque and straightforward. It takes a little less than an hour to make the trip.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;

    &#60;h2&#62;Explore Medieval Lucerne with First Class Tickets to Switzerland&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
    Once your first class tickets have transported you to Zurich, your train ride leads directly to Old Town Lucerne. This captivating city center is exceptionally walkable so there&#38;#8217;s no need to book a car or worry about bus schedules. Lucerne&#38;#8217;s Old Town, or Altstadt, is awash in colorful buildings and historic sites. It&#38;#8217;s perched along the Reuss River, perfect for an afternoon stroll or a pleasant bike ride.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    For its small size, Altstadt overflows with compelling structures, sights and experiences.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    -&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.luzern.com/en/sightseeing-tours/sightseeing/chapel-bridge&#34;&#62;Chapel Bridge&#60;/a&#62;&#38;#160;is one of Lucerne&#38;#8217;s most recognizable structures, and it&#38;#8217;s central to Altstadt. Originally built in the 14th century, this beautiful wooden bridge was rebuilt in the 1990s following a devastating fire. The bridge&#38;#8217;s intricate details and fascinating artwork was lovingly recreated so today&#38;#8217;s visitors can continue to enjoy the landmark. Many of its components remain original to the bridge, including the water tower.&#60;br /&#62;
    -The well-preserved City Walls capture the feel of the Middle Ages with their thick expanse and defensive towers.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    -Lucerne&#38;#8217;s iconic Lion Monument also stands proudly in Altstadt. It honors the sacrifice of Swiss men who perished during the French Revolution.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Altstadt is close to Lucerne&#38;#8217;s main train station, so it&#38;#8217;s also a good place to begin day trips outside of the city.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;h2&#62;Cruising With First Class Tickets to Lucerne&#60;/h2&#62;

There, you&#38;#8217;ll board the world&#38;#8217;s steepest rack and pinion railway to head to Pilatus&#38;#8217; summit.

    &#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;

Known for its exquisite Late Gothic Manueline architecture, the monastery also boasts Spanish Plateresque and Renaissance architecture. It took 100 years to create this majestic and opulent monastery, beginning in 1501 and finishing in 1601. Today, its brilliance and importance are recognized in its World Heritage status.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Jer&#38;oacute;nimos is beloved for its intricately sculpted arches and impressive towers. Its design features are a visual feast, and visitors enjoy taking in its elaborate details. Some favorite design and architectural elements include:&#60;br /&#62;
    -The half-relief depiction of Saint Jerome located above the grand South Portal&#38;#8217;s door,&#60;br /&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
    Bel&#38;eacute;m Tower is iconic, rising above the Tagus River as a testament to the city&#38;#8217;s strength and resilience. Built in the early 16th century, the tower was a fortification to defend the city. Its long and storied past is a fascinating glimpse into Portugal&#38;#8217;s history and culture. Spain overtook the tower in the late 16th century, using the tower dungeon as a prison. During the early 19th-century Peninsular War, France housed some of its invading forces in the tower.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Like Jer&#38;oacute;nimos Monastery, the tower is a superb example of Manueline architecture with a mix of other captivating styles. Some of its most notable features are:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
    At the heart of ancient Athens, the Acropolis stood as the heart and spiritual soul of the city. Today, the ruins of the Acropolis are so significant that UNESCO calls it &#38;#8220;the symbol of world heritage.&#38;#8221;&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    While on the Acropolis hill, you&#38;#8217;ll see a number of incredible ruins:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Visitors pass by the remarkable marble Propylaea at the entrance to the site.&#38;#160;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;The legendary Parthenon sits at the center of the Acropolis, with its august columns and remaining frieze carvings still in place.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;The Temple of Athena Nike is southwest of the Propylaea, sporting a notable portico and many newly refurbished elements.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;The Erechtheum features the famed maidens of Caryatids who hold up the temple roof.&#38;#160;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;

    &#60;h2&#62;Discover Ancient Lifestyles with First Class Deals to Athens and Agora&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
    Also at the base of the Acropolis rests the ruins of one of the most important spaces in ancient Athens. The&#38;#160;&#60;a href=&#34;http://greeklandscapes.com/greece/athens_agora.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;Agora&#60;/a&#62;&#38;#160;was the center of Athenian daily life, serving as a town marketplace, gathering spot and performance space. It was used for religious processions, sporting competitions and military parades. Archaeological efforts have excavated a number of the public building that once surrounded the square, including:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;the Athens mint,&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;magistrate&#38;#8217;s office,&#60;/li&#62;

    &#60;li&#62;the city/state archives.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
    One of the site&#38;#8217;s most fascinating ruins is the Temple of Hephaestus, dating back to 450 B.C.E. Its Doric style is well-preserved and classic, a gorgeous representation of ancient Athens&#38;#8217; style and artistry. Also on site is the Stoa of Attalos, once the major shopping center of ancient Athens. Today, it&#38;#8217;s a captivating museum displaying the artifacts found in the Agora complex. The Agora rests at the northern base of the Acropolis hill, so views are prime here. The space is relatively flat and easily navigated, so it&#38;#8217;s often one of the first stops visitors make after their first class flights land.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;h2&#62;First Class Deals to Athens Reveals The Treasures of Kaerameikos&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
    While many Athenian sites reveal the ins and outs of everyday ancient life, Kerameikos shows how the society treated its dead. Most of the original and elaborate grave markers that once stood in the cemetery have been moved to the National Museum. Still, a few replicas and other markers remain. Kerameikos is often overlooked by visitors, but it&#38;#8217;s a superb spot to visit after &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/service/first-class-specials&#34;&#62;first class deals&#60;/a&#62; to Athens have landed.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    One of the necropolis&#38;#8217; most appealing features is the Dipylon Gate. The gate was used in ancient times for the Panathenaic procession and as an entrance to the city. Visitors can also see many of the site&#38;#8217;s treasures in the on-site museum. Some of the museum&#38;#8217;s artifacts include:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;a collection of intricately carved and sculpted Dipylon vases that were used to mark grave sites,&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Dexileos&#38;#8217; grave relief from 390 B.C.E.,&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;a beautiful white-ground Lekythos vessel and&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;a marble bull statue that once stood atop Dionysius of Kollitos&#38;#8217;s grave temple.&#60;/li&#62;

    For Dubrovnik, the sightseeing begins as &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/service/one-way-business-class-tickets&#34;&#62;business class flights&#60;/a&#62; approach the airport. One of Dubrovnik&#38;#8217;s most recognizable and awe-inspiring sights, the city walls have stood strong for 700 years. These impossibly thick walls completely surround Old Town, providing excellent views from the fort towers. From this walltop vantage point, visitors overlook the city&#38;#8217;s weathered tile roofs, narrow stepped streets and the azure Adriatic.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    For hundreds of years, the city walls were central to life in Dubrovnik, and today is no exception.&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;In the summer, visitors are delighted to watch Shakespeare and other theatrical performances taking place along the wall&#38;#8217;s forts.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;People-watching from the Pile Gate is particularly appealing, overlooking the city&#38;#8217;s main promenade, the Stradun.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Imagine yourself as a royal from &#38;quot;Game of Thrones.&#38;quot; Aided with a little CGI magic, these walls are the setting of many King&#38;#8217;s Landing scenes.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

Many of Dubrovnik&#38;#8217;s early buildings did not survive a large 17th-century earthquake, but Sponza endured. As a vital part of life in the early Republic of Dubrovnik, the palace served as the customs office and treasury. These were critical roles because of Dubrovnik&#38;#8217;s status as a major international port and trading center.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Some of the palace&#38;#8217;s most notable architectural and design elements feature:&#60;/div&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;An inviting interior arcaded courtyard,&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;A sculpted medallion on the palace&#38;#8217;s back wall featuring Jesus&#38;#8217; monogram and two angels and&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;The names of saints engraved on the courtyard arches.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;div&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
    Today, the historic palace houses several important institutions and events:&#60;/div&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;The Memorial Room of Defenders;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;The national archives, which include 100,000 manuscripts, some dating back to the 11th century;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;The opening ceremony of Dubrovnik Summer Festival in which actors portray the Republic of Dubrovnik leaders.&#60;/li&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
    Visitors have Richard the Lionhearted to thank for the glorious Cathedral of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary. Often simply called the Dubrovnik Cathedral, the Byzantine church was reportedly constructed with funds donated by Richard I. As with many of Dubrovnik&#38;#8217;s medieval structures, the cathedral was destroyed in the 1667 earthquake. In its place, today&#38;#8217;s beautiful Romaesque cathedral was constructed.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    The cathedral is visually stunning, with a variety of artistic and architectural elements. Some of the cathedral&#38;#8217;s highlights include:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;The saint statues located in the front facade&#38;#8217;s gable and niches,&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;A 16th-century Titian polyptych in the main altar and&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;The towering vaulted nave.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
    The cathedral is also home to a stunning treasury featuring dozens of reliquaries, including:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Saint Blaise&#38;#8217;s gold-plated skull, arm and leg;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;A 13th-century icon of Madonna and Child;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;A relic of the True Cross.&#60;br /&#62;

    &#60;h2&#62;Lokrum Island Sites Are the Ideal Reason to Book Business Class Flights to Dubrovnik&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
    Dubrovnik is blessed with many popular beaches, but its nearby Lokrum Island is a special treat. It&#38;#8217;s just a half-mile from Dubrovnik&#38;#8217;s shore, and it boasts a fascinating history all its own. The island is where Richard the Lionhearted took refuge after his ship wrecked following his third Crusade. According to local legend, the&#38;#160;island also was the focus of a curse&#38;#160;plaguing owners of the island for centuries. For this reason, travelers won&#38;#8217;t find any hotels on the island, but they will find plenty of recreation and entertainment.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Attractions on the island include:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;A historic Benedictine monastery that was the source of the island&#38;#8217;s curse;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;A colorful botanical garden that is inhabited by the island&#38;#8217;s equally vibrant peacocks;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Several fun-filled beaches;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;The small Dead Sea, a saltwater lake that&#38;#8217;s perfect for swimming on the south end of the island;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Volleyball and football fields in the olive grove meadow and&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;The Purple Cave, a hidden cavern on the way to the island&#38;#8217;s nude beach.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
    Few European cities have preserved and treasured their old town centers as faithfully as Stockholm has. Its Old Town, or Gamla Stan, is a picturesque network of cozy cobblestone streets and gold-hued medieval buildings. This historic city center dates back to Stockholm&#38;#8217;s founding in 1252, and its heritage shows in every nook and cranny. For instance, its oldest public square, Stortorget, was the site of the 1520 massacre known as the Stockholm Bloodbath.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Technically, Gamla Stan covers the islands and islets of Stadsholmen, Riddarholmen, Helgeandsholmen and Stromsborg. This provides plenty of space for the district&#38;#8217;s abundant galleries, museums, cafes, boutiques and bridges. Some of the historic area&#38;#8217;s most popular attractions are:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;the Royal Palace,&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;the Nobel Museum,&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;the National Museums of Economy,&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Stortorget Square,&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;the Post Museum and&#38;#160;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Stockholm Cathedral.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
    Visitors especially delight in the changing of the guard ceremony outside the Royal Palace. Previous monarchs and members of the royal family are buried in the beautiful Riddarholmskyrkan. The district&#38;#8217;s annual fairytale Christmas market is just one reason travelers can&#38;#8217;t resist business class deals to Stockholm.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;

    &#60;br /&#62;
    The palace&#38;#8217;s Chinese Pavilion is especially entrancing with its rococo interior overflowing with silks and lacquered panels. Many of these textiles and decorative pieces were brought to the palace by the 18th-century Swedish East India Company.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    The palace&#38;#8217;s main building is even more sublime, considered one of Europe&#38;#8217;s best preserved palaces. It is known for its ornate rooms, commodious size and stellar grounds. Among the palace&#38;#8217;s highlights are:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Gustav V&#38;#8217;s tapestry in the Palace Chapel,&#60;/li&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
    A seafaring culture, Stockholm boasts several maritime museums and exhibits. The pinnacle of these collections is the 17th-century ship, the&#38;#160;&#60;em&#62;Vasa&#60;/em&#62;. While the Vasa sank on her maiden voyage in 1628, the ship lives on in the Vasa Museum. The ship is housed in the museum itself, offering incredible views of its six levels. Around the ship, visitors can see films showing the ship&#38;#8217;s recovery, exhibits about maritime Sweden and 40,000 artifacts.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    In addition to the captivating&#38;#160;&#60;em&#62;Vasa&#60;/em&#62;&#38;#160;exhibit inside, the museum offers four compelling ship museums at its port.&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;li&#62;The&#38;#160;&#60;em&#62;Sankt Erik&#60;/em&#62;&#38;#160;was completed in 1915, designed to break up ice and navigate the frigid northern seas. The first icebreaker in use by Stockholm,&#38;#160;&#60;em&#62;Sankt Erik&#60;/em&#62;&#38;#160;was vital to keeping the city&#38;#8217;s shipping channels clear.&#60;/li&#62;
