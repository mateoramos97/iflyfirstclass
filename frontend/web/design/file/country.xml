</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;h3&#62;Why Visit Japan&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Japan was the first Asian country to become a first-world country, an amazing feat of resilience and hard work for which the industrious nation is renowned. Japanese culture is a wonder of etiquette, great respect and incredible innovation.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Japan is cleaner, safer and more orderly as a country than most small neighborhoods could ever hope to be. Its food is famous the world but it is best experienced in its true home.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Even though Japanese inventions and technology have shaped our world for the past few decades, Japan is home to 17 UNESCO World Heritage sites. There is still remarkable respect and honor for their ancient heritage. Beautiful, exquisite temple and shrines are a wonderful contrast to the modernity and style of its major cities.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Which cities in Japan are a must-see?&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Japan is great mix of old, new and what the future will hold for the rest of the world. She is also a gorgeous peek into a glorious heritage that has always put personal and societal honor above individualism.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Here are the best picks of Japan&#38;#8217;s cities:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/city/to-tokyo-hnd&#34; title=&#34;first class flights to Tokyo&#34;&#62;Tokyo&#60;/a&#62; &#38;ndash; Without a doubt, Tokyo will be the number one on any list of Japanese cities. The world&#38;#39;s largest metropolitan city is known for its spectacular skyscrapers and thick foot traffic. There are restaurants and eateries galore, giving it more Michelin stars than any other city.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;The Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden and spring cherry blossoms prove that it is not all about technology and modernity.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Kyoto &#38;ndash; Of Japan&#38;#8217;s 17 UNESCO sites, 14 lie in Kyoto, a result of its ancient history as the nation&#38;#8217;s capital. So very different from Tokyo, this city has over 2,200 traditional temples and shrines, each with a thrilling history to go with the intricate architecture.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Kamakura &#38;ndash; This seaside city is just south of Tokyo and is a great mix of fun and culture. Kotoku-in and Hasa-dera are just two of the great Buddhist monuments to see. But it is the surf culture that is pulling in the crowds today.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;h3&#62;Flight characteristics&#38;#160;&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The United States and Japan are separated by the Pacific Ocean and the closest major U.S. city to the shores of the Asian nation is Honolulu. A direct flight between Honolulu and Tokyo is of 8 hours 13 minutes&#38;#8217; duration.&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Many major airlines operate direct flights between the U.S. and Japan from New York and Los Angeles. Delta&#38;#8217;s 13 hour 45-minute-long trip is the shortest from NY and Great Lakes Airlines&#38;#8217; 11-hour flight from L.A. is the shortest from the west coast.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;While all airlines offer great perks on this route, perhaps the most luxurious service is offered by JAL. Its enclosed suites with lie-flat beds, 23-inch personal entertainment screens, sommelier-qualified in-flight staff and masterful cuisine creations tops most.&#60;/p&#62;

</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;h3&#62;Why Visit Vietnam?&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Vietnam is an exotic mix, even for a nation in Southeast Asia. Her people are ethnically close to the Chinese but she has traditions of Buddhism and Hinduism absorbed from India, while French colonialism has also left its mark.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;This rich heritage is most readily seen in its architecture and its food. Most visitors are pleasantly surprised at how affordable scrumptious meals are all over the country. Fresh fruit is abundant and just as cheap.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Nature has truly blessed Vietnam with beauty and varied terrain. Her gorgeous beaches, verdant plains and towering mountains are welcome escapes. Vietnam is not as popular on the tourist trail yet and many of her gems are still in pristine condition and free of commercialism like that found in neighboring countries.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Must-see Cities in Vietnam&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Travellers from all over the world name the following 3 cities as a 100% must-see destinations:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Hanoi &#38;ndash; The capital city which is a thousand years old is the center of politics and offers some of the best educational experiences in the country. The Imperial Citadel, Water Puppet Theater, Perfume Pagoda and Ba Vi National Park are well worth a visit.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/city/to-ho-chi-minh-city-sgn&#34; title=&#34;First Class flights to Ho Chi Minh City&#34;&#62;Ho Chi Minh City&#60;/a&#62; &#38;ndash; This city is Vietnam&#38;#8217;s pulsating heart. HCMC, as it has become popularly known, is an exciting introduction to Vietnam&#38;#39;s heritage through the good times and bad. The Notre Dame Cathedral, Giac Lam Pagoda, Jade Emperor Pagoda and War Remnants Museum all have their stories to tell.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Nha Trang - An ebullient mix of old and new, Nha Trang&#38;#39;s center is still home to ancient Hindu temple towers while her coast is an ever-changing testament to its reputation as a burgeoning party town.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Flight characteristics&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Vietnam continues to work its way up as a world tourist destination but there are currently no direct flights between the United States and the Asian nation.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;From Los Angeles&#38;#8217; LAX, Cathay Pacific flies to Hanoi&#38;#8217;s Noibai International Airport (HAN) in 18 hours 40 minutes, with a layover at Hong Kong. This is the shortest flight between the United States and Vietnam.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The shortest one-stop flight from New York&#38;#8217;s JKFK Airport to HAN is operated by British Air and transits through London Heathrow (LHR). The journey takes 19 hours 55 minutes to complete. Delta Air Lines transits through Charles de Gaulle (CDG) in Paris and takes 15 minutes longer.&#60;/p&#62;

</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;h3&#62;Why Visit Qatar&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Qatar rises out of the desert, transformed over the past decades by uncountable billions in oil revenue. The nation has adopted an approach akin to many of its gulf neighbours of using that revenue to transform itself from an arid, largely featureless expanse of land into a diversified economy built around travel and tourism.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;It has welcomed international talent and businesses to diversify its own people as well as its economy. Today, Qatar stands as one of the shining examples in the Middle East of a nation that has loosened its grip on a monotonous past to embrace technology, cultures and a more modern outlook on life.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;A visit to Qatar will give you the opportunity to see how the past has shaped the desert nation and how the present its shaping its exciting future.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Must-see Cities in Qatar&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Qatar is still a developing nation and there are not that many metropolises rising out of the sand dunes&#38;hellip; yet. For the traveller, there are two that have to be part of the Qatari experience &#38;ndash; Doha and Al Khor.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Doha &#38;ndash; Doha is the capital city and where the bulk of the modernisation of Qatar has taken place.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Perhaps one of the best-known links Qatar has with the rest of the world is through T.E. Lawrence, aka Lawrence of Arabia. The Weaponry Museum has in its collection a ceremonial dagger that belonged to him, besides many other arms and pieces of armour, some dating back to the 1500s.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;MIA Park is a lush oasis of green in the desert turned into steel desert that is Doha. Just along the Doha waterfront, it houses sculptures by international artists and also hosts a monthly bazaar that is well worth a look.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Qatari culture is famous for its use of falcons for hunting. The Falcon Souk (traditional market) allows visitors to catch an up-close and personal glimpse at these majestic birds and their graceful, if somewhat scary, presence.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Al Khor - this city played a critical part in Qatar&#38;#39;s development due to its proximity to the oil and natural gas fields nearby. The Al-Sultan is an opulent palace that has been turned into a hotel.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Al-Khor is home to one of the country&#38;#39;s largest parks - 240,000 sq. metres in all. Purple Island lies just offshore and is connected to the mainland by a narrow track. It is regarded an important ecotourism destination in Qatar.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;h3&#62;Flight Characteristics&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Qatar Airways is the only airline that provides nonstop flights between the United States and Qatar:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;li&#62;It operates two daily direct flights from New York&#38;#39;s JFK Airport to Doha, one that departs at 11:15 a.m. and the other that leaves at 10:00 p.m.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;The flight cruises at a speed of 552 mph at an altitude of 11,280 m.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Both flights have a duration of 12 hours 15 minutes.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;These flights are usually delayed by less than an hour at both departure and arrival.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Travelers have the option of two variations of the business class seat - Business Value and Business Flexi - which offer different privileges.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;There are lie-flat seats and the international cabin crew has developed a reputation for exceedingly attentive service.&#38;#160;&#60;/li&#62;

</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;h3&#62;Why Visit Italy&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Italy has always been synonymous with passion; passion for food, for wine and for love.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;It is a nation that has produced some of the greatest works of art, music and architecture in the past, and continues to blaze the trail in innovation, technology and the arts today.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Italy&#38;#8217;s ancient Roman civilisation created spectacular monuments that still stand, as well as priceless works of art that have enthralled people for centuries. Many of the world&#38;#8217;s most recognisable luxury brands in fashion and motoring were born here.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;A visit to Italy is a sure way to unlock hidden passions in your own soul and indulge in a feast of the senses in some of Europe&#38;#39;s most scenic, vibrant and modern cities.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Must-see Italian Cities&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Rome - Rome is undeniably the best city to appreciate Italy&#38;#8217;s rich ancient history and heritage and understand how and why it came to be recognised as one of the most important civilizations the world has ever seen.&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The Pantheon and Colosseum, built two millennia ago still stand strong considering the ravages they have seen. Both buildings are icons of our collective conscience and have been featured in movies, TV and literature to be instantly recognisable by most.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;St. Peter&#38;#8217;s Basilica, the Platino palace ruins and the priceless art collection of the museums are just some of the many Roman draws.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/city/to-venice-vce&#34; title=&#34;First class flight to Venice&#34;&#62;Venice&#60;/a&#62; &#38;ndash; if Italy is the home of love then Venice is its heart. A slow ride down the Venetian canals in its gondolas are one of the most romantic things for a couple to indulge in. The 150 canals are watched over by over 400 bridges of varying ages and styles.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Be wowed by the awe-inspiring architecture of Saint Mark&#38;#8217;s Basilica - its array of interior and exterior design and decoration truly is a wonder to the eyes.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Florence &#38;ndash; the capital of Italy&#38;#8217;s wine region of Tuscany is the place to indulge in your love of Renaissance Art. Set your eyes on one of the world&#38;#8217;s most famous sculptures, Michelangelo&#38;#8217;s &#38;#39;David&#38;#8217; at Galleria dell&#38;#39;Accademia. Or admire the terracotta-tiled dome of the Duomo cathedral.&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;h3&#62;Flight Characteristics&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;If you are on the west coast of the United States, a direct flight from New York to Rome will get you there in just over 8 hours. This flight is offered by Alitalia, the Italian national airline. Delta Airlines completes the same route, also non-stop, in 8 hours 3 minutes.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;There are no direct flights to any Italian airport from the western United States. A single-stop flight will take approximately 13 hours and usually makes a layover at New York. There is a wide variety of flight combinations you can take with this option.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Cities like Rome are major international tourism and business hubs &#38;ndash; there is no shortage of airlines offering first class and business class seats to travellers heading there.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;From Castles to Skyscrapers, Architecture Delights Throughout Germany&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Known for its picturesque and clean streets filled with sculpted gardens and flourishing flowers, Germany is a leading economic and political power. Its thriving economy is displayed in its gleaming cities and bustling business districts.&#60;br /&#62;

    In quintessential European fashion, Germany&#38;#39;s big cities offer just as many heritage and cultural sites as they do skyscrapers and financial centers. In Berlin, marvel at the artistry of 17th century Charlottenburg Palace, the famed Brandenburg Gate, and the masterpieces at Alte Nationalgalerie on Museum Island. Germany&#38;#39;s poignant history and 20th century reunification is beautifully seen at Oberbaum Bridge. Once a vital crossing point over the River Spree, the bridge became unusable during the height of the Cold War.

    &#60;br /&#62;
    To the south, Munich is resplendent with its Bavarian spirit and heritage sites. The city centers around Marienplatz, the heart of old Munich. Explore the impressive architecture of New Town Hall and the ornate Frauenkirche. Visit the medieval city&#38;#39;s remaining gates and delight in the grandeur of St. Michael&#38;#39;s Church, the largest Renaissance church north of the Alps. The old city center is also home to the domed Theatine Church of St. Cajetan and the region&#38;#39;s first rococo church, St. Anna of Lehel. Not far from Marienplatz, the majestic 14th century Residenz palace complex delights visitors and the magnificence of Nymphenburg Palace entrances visitors tourists with its Baroque facades.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;br /&#62;
    Germany&#38;#39;s other world-class cities offer countless other attractions, from boating in Hamburg, gazing at Frankfurt&#38;#39;s bountiful skyscrapers, browsing through Cologne&#38;#39;s many museums and savoring traditional Altbier in Dusseldorf&#38;#39;s old town.

    &#60;p&#62;Tucked away in the vast South Pacific seas, the country is made up of two main islands and a host of smaller islands. With so many islands involved, New Zealand&#38;#39;s terrain is spectacularly diverse, ranging from warm, tropical beaches to colossal, permanently frozen glaciers and rugged mountain ranges. That variety in terrain gives New Zealand its abundant thrill-seeking activities, including rappelling, caving, mountain climbing, kayaking, wind surfing, white water rafting and bungee jumping.

</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;h3&#62;Why Visit the Philippines&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The Philippines is a nation whose character is shaped by its geography. 7,000 islands constitute the country which lies isolated by the South China Sea from the rest of the Southeast Asian nations.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;This isolation made it less susceptible to their influence and the Philippines does not share the Hindu and Buddhist heritage common to the region; it was the Spanish colonisation that has had the most significant effect on the Filipino people and their culture.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;This gives the country a unique architecture and persona, more akin to South America than to Asia.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Where Thailand has its tuk tuks, the Philippines has its jeepneys, the colourful, often-overcrowded works of contemporary art that function as buses and taxis. Its beaches have been voted among the best in the world and the Filipinos are friendly and welcoming.&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Must-see Cities in the Philippines&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Manila &#38;ndash; the capital of the Philippines is home to several of its most resplendent monuments, best museums and art galleries and also the most exciting nightlife.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The National Museum of the Filipino People is a good introduction to the journey of the Philippines through the ages - from 26,000-year old headgear worn by the land&#38;#39;s earliest resident to precious items salvaged from a Spanish ship that capsized in 1600 A.D. to indigenous textiles and musical instruments.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The Metropolitan Museum of Manila is the place to get your finger on the pulse of contemporary Filipino art. The Rizal shrine is dedicated to Jose Rizal, a national hero regarded as the inspiration for Filipino independence from Spain. The collection here contains his writings as well as a vertebra.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Cebu City &#38;ndash; Cebu City is the capital of Cebu province and the ideal place to get to know the faith in religion that Filipinos have and the colonial history where it originated.&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Magellan&#38;#39;s Cross is the site where Ferdinand Magellan installed the first cross, officially bringing Christianity to the Philippines. Santo Nino Church is the oldest in the Philippines and still holds services.&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;For something of a lighter vein, visit IT Park - several of its collection of restaurants are famous for their signature dishes. The three-tiered Kawasan waterfalls are a very popular hangout for their beauty and serenity.&#60;/p&#62;

</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;h3&#62;Why Visit India?&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;India possesses a unique mystical charm, an aura of spirituality that has always defied complete comprehension. It has a deep connection to its ancient spiritual heritage, something which has drawn visitors eager to uncover its secrets to the shores of the subcontinent for centuries.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;There is probably no place in the world more aligned with nature and aware of the balance we are entrusted to maintain with it.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;A journey around India is a journey of discovery beyond tourist attractions. Even far from the famed ghats of Varanasi, out of sight of ancient temples and their intricate age-old carvings, away from rituals performed unchanged for millennia, India regales the senses with experiences that will linger for the rest of your life.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Must-see Indian Cities&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;New Delhi &#38;ndash; the capital and the seat of power is a booming metropolis. The wide streets and well-planned organisation of the newer parts of the city, particularly near the diplomatic enclave, prove that India can be orderly when it wants to be.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The Rajpath avenue runs from the President&#38;#8217;s official residence and office to India Gate to the National Stadium. It is also exceedingly beautiful, with majestic official buildings, lawns and canals gracing either side.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The Swaminarayan Akshardham Temple is among the most beautiful and intricate buildings in the world. It was built entirely by over 8,000 volunteers who spent dedicated over 300 million man hours to the task.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Varanasi &#38;ndash; the world&#38;#8217;s oldest continuously-inhabited city has been a must-see for visitors for its famed Ganges ghats (wide platform steps leading down to a river). Known as the City of Temples, Varanasi is the heart of Hinduism and an essential pilgrimage to Hindus and people of all religions seeking serenity.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Mumbai &#38;ndash; India&#38;#8217;s financial capital is also home to &#38;#39;Bollywood&#38;#8217;, India&#38;#8217;s film industry. The Gateway of India stone arch, built in 1924 by the British is a monument worth visiting for both the architecture and the carnival atmosphere. Off Mumbai&#38;#8217;s coast lies Elephanta Island, the site of ancient cave temples dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Ladakh &#38;ndash; Ladakh looks like an imagined landscape almost too beautiful to be true. Situated at 4,530 m, it is a series of high-altitude blue lakes under the blue sky which continually shift and change shape as the day passes.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;h3&#62;Flight Characteristics&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;A flight to New Delhi from New York has a duration of just under 14 hours while a flight to Mumbai takes about 17 hours. &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/airline/american-airlines&#34;&#62;American Airlines&#60;/a&#62;, Delta, United, JetBlue and Air India offer non-stop flights to India from New York.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Currently, no airline offers direct flights from the American west coast to India. Most will layover at JFK in New York. A Los Angeles to New York flight will add about 4 to 5 hours to the trip duration.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The United States to India sector is booming as trade between the two nations has grown steadily &#38;ndash; most airlines offer premium services to fliers on first class and business class seats:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;lie-flat beds;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;excellent Western, Indian and world cuisine;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;and the very best in in-flight entertainment await you.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Why buy tickets with I Fly First Class&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder but you would be hard pressed to find anyone who did not find Scotland&#38;#39;s myriad land and seascapes absolutely stunning.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;From waves born of deep waters crashing upon ancient rock shores, to azure blue skies gazing upon marvelous medieval architecture still standing ever so strong, to golden shafts of warm sunlight shimmering across verdant green hills and valleys - Scotland is a treat for the eyes and nourishment for the soul.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Scotland&#38;#8217;s rich heritage pervades our collective experiences through the charm of tartan patterns, the mysterious appeal of the kilt and the enchanting notes of bagpipes.

The view of castles and spires from Arthur&#38;#8217;s Seat (a craggy hill) is awe-inspiring. The city is home to the famous Edinburgh Military Tattoo, which attracts participants and audiences from the world over.&#60;/li&#62;

It is a cultural draw for visitors from all over the globe. The Riverside Museum, which is Scotland&#38;#39;s Museum of Transport &#38;amp; Travel, and the Kelvingrove Art Gallery &#38;amp; Museum are two must-sees. Entry to the latter is free!&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Aberdeen &#38;ndash; home to the Highland Games. If you do not know what that is, you have to find out. The Games were the ancient Scottish way to discover who the strongest men in the land were, and it involves men throwing huge logs, tossing huge boulders and other superbly wonderful sights. Yes, the participants wear kilts.&#60;/li&#62;

</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;h3&#62;Why Visit Ireland?&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Anyone who has been to Ireland will tell you that for all the wondrous, gorgeous, mystical and historic places for which the Emerald Isle is famous, its true beauty is in its people. From the lilting music of the Irish accent to the Irish love for a pint and the remarkable friendliness of seemingly everyone you meet, your interaction with the people of this amazing island will leave you certain that there is something in the water here.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;But you would be remiss to not explore the country and discover its exciting history, steeped as it is in tales of conquest and of religion, of great battles and of sobering armistices. The country&#38;#8217;s geography is undulating lush vegetation for miles on end, which explains the association of the Irish with the color green. Towering castles and ancient Celtic architecture abound so it does not ever become monotonous.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Many components of ancient, traditional Irish culture have found their way into world popular culture. The international celebrations of St. Patrick&#38;#39;s Day (Saint Patrick is Ireland&#38;#8217;s patron saint), the intricate lines and designs of Celtic architecture and art, the heart-quickening tunes of Irish music and the unique, almost gravity-defying deeds of Irish dancers make a touch of the Irish a welcome one all over the world.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The country has contributed immensely to the world of writing; Irishmen C.S. Lewis, Oscar Wilde, Jonathan Swift, George Bernard Shaw and William Butler Yeats are giants of literature, with the last two having won the Nobel Prize for Literature.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;It would be a sin to mention Ireland, its people and their love for a pint and neglect to mention Guinness. The thick, black dry stout has been virtually synonymous with Ireland&#38;#8217;s huge pub scene and over 220 million gallons of &#38;lsquo;the black stuff&#38;#8217; is sold every year. Sipping it at the brewery where it was first conceived in 1759 is as good a reason as any to visit!&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Must-See Irish Cities&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Ireland&#38;#8217;s rich history makes for an exciting destination. Coupled with its myriad festivals scattered over the year and the modern wonders of its younger self, there is always something to see here. These are the best cities to visit to get the most revealing insight into the personality of this intriguing land:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Kilmainham Gaol (Jail), The Guinness Brewery, the National Print Museum of Ireland and the National Library of Ireland are all worth a visit. And when you have had enough of stuffy buildings, wander out and discover the beautiful hills and coastline.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Fans of history will love Kilkenny Castle, Ballybur Castle and Black Abbey. Fans of the arts will love the mixture of professional and amateur performances at Barnstorm Theatre and Ballykeeffe Amphitheatre respectively.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;●&#38;#160;&#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/city/to-dublin-dub&#34;&#62;Dublin&#60;/a&#62; &#38;ndash; the nation&#38;#8217;s capital has been home to many an established Irish writer and has been designated a UNESCO City of Literature. The Long Room in Trinity College has felt the footsteps of CS Lewis, Samuel Beckett, James Joyce and Seamus Heaney.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;●&#38;#160;Kilkenny - established in medieval times, Kilkenny is the sight to visit for monasteries and churches maintained to remarkable standards. The city has also developed a more modern side, with some of the best bars and restaurants.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;●&#38;#160;Limerick &#38;ndash; famous as the origin of the eponymous genre of poetry, Limerick is a major tourist destination. St. John&#38;#8217;s Cathedral which sports the country&#38;#8217;s tallest spire, King John&#38;#8217;s castle which is one of the best preserved Norman castles, the elegantly restrained St. Mary&#38;#8217;s Cathedral and The Hunt Museum which hold Stone Age artifacts and drawings by Picasso are all worth a close look.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Flight Characteristics&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The direct cross-Atlantic trip by air to Ireland from the continental United States can be as short as 6 hours 15 minutes from the east coast to just 10 hours from west coast cities like Los Angeles. In the case of flights with transit stops, the trip can take over 32 hours.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Delta, United, Lufthansa, Aer Lingus and Air France are some of the major airlines that operate flights between the U.S. and Ireland. As can be expected with &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/service/first-class-specials&#34;&#62;first class service&#60;/a&#62;, they provide options for chef-prepared meals off a pre-ordered menu or your choice on board. Meals are accompanied by premium wine and liquor from their selection.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Some of the best airlines feature lie-flat beds to help the journey go by in a breeze.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Why Buy Tickets with I Fly First Class?&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;I Fly First Class takes the work out of planning your first class trip. Instead of waiting to get on board to enjoy premium care, you can use our personalized booking service to get to the head of the queue and enjoy massive savings at the same time.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Waited too long to book your first class or business class ticket? Are the online boking sites telling you there are no first class seats? Are other charging ridiculous prices for them?&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Have no worry, I Fly First Class has the network of connections to bring it all within your reach, and at an affordable price.

</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;h3&#62;Why Visit Iceland?&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Although it lies just 170 miles from the Arctic Circle, the name &#38;lsquo;Iceland&#38;#8217; is a slight misnomer &#38;ndash; it is more accurately defined by its popular description &#38;lsquo;The Land of Fire and Ice&#38;#8217;.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The tiny, sparsely-populated nation is a study in contrasts. It might be blanketed in snow for most of the year and host some of Europe&#38;#8217;s largest glaciers but it is also home to fiery active volcanoes and piping hot geysers and hot springs.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Some of the most beautiful sights humans have ever been fortunate to witness may be observed from the hauntingly desolate terrain of Iceland. The Aurora Borealis or Northern Lights make a spectacular addition to the Icelandic night sky, letting many eager travelers cross one sight off their respective bucket lists. In the summer, Iceland&#38;#8217;s location on the globe means that the sun does not set but travels in a slow circle around the sky.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;130 dormant and active volcanoes dot the otherwise frigid landscape, leaching heat from the depths of the earth to create bubbling oases of rejuvenation. If you want to go from blistering cold to searing heat in the space of a mile, Iceland&#38;#8217;s famous volcano treks will take you from featureless snow to the searing orange heat of lava. For adventures less temperature-related, visitors can descend into dormant volcanoes or fly safely over them in a helicopter.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Iceland was settled by fearsome Vikings in the ninth century A.D. and across the island, castles till stand that allude to its exciting past. Much of Iceland is untouched wilderness and an escapist wonderland for anyone who wants to reconnect with nature&#38;#8217;s flora and fauna.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Most of Iceland may be cold but its people are the very opposite &#38;ndash; welcoming, garrulous and warm. This has made it an otherwise surprising center of the arts in Europe.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Reykjavik was the first non-English-speaking world capital to be inducted into the UNESCO City of Literature list. From literature to music, the population of just 300,000 continues to astound the world with the creativity it so willingly shares, including the 1 million tourists who visit annually.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The country is renowned for being one of the cleanest and greenest in the world.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Must See Icelandic Cities&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Iceland&#38;#8217;s extremes of temperature mean that vast swathes of the country are not permanently populated.&#38;#160; The population is distributed across the country in dense (relative to the rest of the place!) pockets, each with its own character.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/city/to-reykjavik-rkv&#34;&#62;Reykjavik&#60;/a&#62; - Iceland&#38;#8217;s capital is its largest city and home to about two-thirds of the entire Icelandic population. Situated on the southwestern coast of the island, the city center is modern and very cosmopolitan and boasts a very lively nightlife scene. If you can, be there on March 1, officially celebrated as Beer Day.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Harpa, the futuristic concert hall designed to resemble the country&#38;#8217;s geography is a tourist favorite. Fans of art should visit Gufunes estate which is renowned for its artwork and sculptures. Hallgr&#38;iacute;mskirkja is the magnificent 244 feet high church in the shape of Iceland&#38;#8217;s jagged peaks which is visible across the city. The city also boasts numerous nature reserves.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;H&#38;uacute;sav&#38;iacute;k - H&#38;uacute;sav&#38;iacute;k is supposedly the site of the first settlement in Iceland and the biggest town in the country&#38;#8217;s north. It has grown immensely in popularity because many species of whale come to frolic in the waters of its bay. There is even a whale museum for you to get your fill. The surrounding areas are great for exploration on foot or by bike.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Siglufjordur - probably the best Icelandic city to visit in winter, Siglufjordur offers every type of fun in the snow that you could imagine in winter. During the summer months, its thaws out enough for it to transform into the ideal location for fishing and golf. For something offbeat, the Herring Museum does not disappoint.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Flight Characteristics&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;A non-stop flight to Reykjavik from a U.S. city on the eastern seaboard like New York takes approximately five and a half hours. Single stop flights take just under ten hours, with Iceland Air making the trip in 9 h 40 min with a layover in Boston between New York and Reykjavik.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;It is hard to find a commercial flight between the western United States to Iceland. Travelers in cities like Los Angeles will have to take flights with at least one layover. These flights reach Reykjavik in just over 11 hours.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;United, Delta, Jet Blue, Alaska Airlines and Iceland Air are the main full-service airlines that fly between the U.S. and Iceland. First class and business class passengers get:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;premium service;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;extra comfortable seating;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;multi-course meals;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;a free flow of drinks while on board.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Why Buy Tickets with I Fly First Class?&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;If you like to experience first class service even before you step on board a plane, your first choice for buying tickets should be I Fly First Class.&#60;/p&#62;

</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;h3&#62;Why Visit Monaco?&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;There are few greater validations of a location&#38;#39;s status as a playground for the rich and famous as a feature in a James Bond film. The principality of Monaco has featured twice.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;If you are more of a numbers person, consider that more than 30% of the local population are millionaires. Its glitzy casinos, piers of multi-million dollar superyachts, constant sightings of Hollywood stars and its glamorous royal family add to an air of hedonistic revelry that not many places in the world can match.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;One of the most famous - some might say notorious - things the world knows about Monaco is that it is a tax haven, something that might have to do with the high incidence of millionaires. Upscale shopping in Monaco squeezes in everything from toiletries to clothes to supercars within a short walk of each other.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;As you might expect, the hotels are luxurious and much of the older architecture was designed by world-famous names like Gustave Eiffel. If your appreciation of beauty extends to more modern creations, there will always be gorgeous luxury cars parked outside every hotel.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Monaco continually invests in its upscale image by hosting world sporting events that belie the nation&#38;#39;s tiny size of just 2.02 square kilometers. Perhaps the most well-known of these is the Monaco Grand Prix which has been hosted by the country since 1929. The Monte Carlo Rally has an even older tradition, dating back to 1911. It also hosts the Monaco International Auto Show, the grand final of the European Poker Tour&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Monaco&#38;#8217;s size means that it is one of the few places in the world from where you can explore 2 other countries within minutes &#38;ndash; &#38;#160;it is a mere 13 kilometers to &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/country/to-france&#34;&#62;France&#60;/a&#62; and 16 kilometers to &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/country/to-italy&#34;&#62;Italy&#60;/a&#62;. The weather is mildly gentle in both summer and winter, meaning you can visit any time of year and explore without discomfort.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Must See Cities in Monaco&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Oh dear, it seems there is no place for more than one city in Monaco. Besides the main city itself, there is an &#38;lsquo;Old Town&#38;#8217; but it is a quaint part of the principality that usually plays second fiddle to the high-rollers and glimpses of celebrity life which are Monaco&#38;#8217;s main draw.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The must-see city of Monaco is therefore:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Monte Carlo &#38;ndash; it may be said that Monte Carlo is Monaco itself. Practically everything for which the nation is famous occurs in Monte Carlo.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;The Monaco Grand Prix takes place in May. It is one of Formula 1&#38;#8217;s signature races and described as its most testing circuit.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;The Monte Carlo harbor boasts some of the most stunning natural vistas as well as a look at some of the most technologically advanced craft that have graced the water anywhere.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;No mention of what to do in the city can be complete without a mention of Casino de Monte-Carlo. There are four others but this is the most opulent.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;The century-old Oceanographic Museum and Aquarium perched atop a sheer cliff offers spectacular views of the top of the ocean from outside and an entrancing look at life beneath the waves with the displays inside.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;li&#62;If the modern supercars cruising the streets do not sate you, you can visit Prince Rainier III&#38;#8217;s own collection of classic cars. Numbering about 100, they range from small coupes to huge, sleek limousines. A car enthusiast&#38;#8217;s dream.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Apart from a who&#38;#8217;s-who list of international celebrities who are constantly visiting the coastal paradise, Monte Carlo is also the permanent home to numerous international sporting and performance celebrities. Catch sight of them anywhere and everywhere about the island.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Flight Characteristics&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Monaco does not have an airport; instead, it makes do with a heliport. As such, there are no direct flights from the United States &#38;ndash; or anywhere else, for that matter &#38;ndash; into Monaco.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The closest airport is Cote d&#38;#8217;Azur airport in Nice, France, and a helicopter flight from there to the Monaco heliport takes just seven minutes. There is a flight every 15 minutes between 8.45 a.m. and 6.14 p.m.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Fliers from eastern U.S. cities like New York can fly non-stop to Nice on Delta or Air France in 8 hours 30 minutes. Interconnecting flights take upwards of 10 hours. From the western United States, the shortest flights to Nice take over 14 hours as there all have layovers.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The time will fly a lot faster if you are travelling first class &#38;ndash; the food, drink, seats and entertainment options are as good as any on a trans-Atlantic flight.&#60;/p&#62;

</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;h3&#62;Why Visit Norway?&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;There is something about the beauty of nature that transfixes the human soul and leaves us changed for the experience. In Norway, that experience is a daily affair.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;What would seem like a featureless wintry wonderland on the surface is actually home to a kaleidoscope of magnificent colors and sights beyond anything you could see anywhere. So many separate elements of nature &#38;ndash; rock, ice, water, snow, sky, cloud and grass - come together to create a stirring landscape that evokes a call to the wild, from the wild.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Norway is one of the best places in the world to see the Northern Lights in their magnificence. It lets you raft down raging river rapids and skateboard down winding mountain roads. It gives you exuberant hussies pulling your sled and only slightly less exuberant whales breaching near your boat. Crystal clear waters are straddled by green hills in the summer, and the sight of golden sunlight reflected off the terrain is heavenly.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Somehow in the middle of the myriad of temptations of wonder that nature has thrown at them, Norwegians have had the time and the presence of mind to create a government and public system that is recognized as the most democratic in the world. It also tops the World Happiness Index and various other rankings concerned with individual and societal welfare.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The challenging terrain has made Norwegians a hardy and sport-loving people. Winter sports like skiing, snowmobiling, ski humping and ice hockey are very popular. In summer, hiking, biking and rafting take the mantle.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Must See Cities in Norway&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Oslo &#38;ndash; the nation&#38;#8217;s capital and largest city is arguably the best city to visit for the myriad of experiences it offers. It is undoubtedly very cosmopolitan and its skyline is punctuated by innovative architectural designs.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;It is a haven for the cultural traveler &#38;ndash; museums and art galleries abound. The National Theatre, the Norwegian Opera &#38;amp; Ballet and the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design all are worth a visit. The Oslo Opera House might look familiar &#38;ndash; it is designed to look like a glacier floating in the sea.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Oslo is renowned for its live music scene and you will be able to catch more than a couple regardless of when you visit. The nightlife is among the best in Scandinavia.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Bergen &#38;ndash; Bergen is Norway&#38;#8217;s second largest city and a beautiful confluence of culture, nature and adventure. Being a university town, it has a youthful character that drives its passion for the arts.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Move into the outskirts to explore towering waterfalls and cerulean lakes bordered by towering mountains that call to the adventurer in you.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Bergen&#38;#8217;s coastal location means that it has developed a delicious local menu, rich in the freshest seafood. There are Michelin starred restaurants that bring an international twist to local favorites.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Troms&#38;oslash; &#38;ndash; this city had to make the list because there are few places in the world that offer a better view of the magical natural phenomenon we call The Northern Lights. Just 3550 kilometers from the Arctic Circle, it is also witness to another mesmerizing sight &#38;ndash; the Midnight Sun, where Sol circles the sky in summer but does not set.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;Known as the &#38;lsquo;Gateway to the Arctic&#38;#8217; because most Arctic expeditions use it as a launch base, it is also a great outdoors destination for:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;kayaking;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;fishing;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;whale watching;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;hiking.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Flight Characteristics&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;There are currently three airlines &#38;ndash; Icelandair, Delta and Lufthansa - that fly from New York&#38;#8217;s JFK Airport on the eastern United States to Oslo. None of them offer a direct option. The layovers are at Reykjavik, Amsterdam and Munich respectively and the total trip duration is between 9 hours and 18 hours.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;From the western U.S., Delta offers the quickest option with a flight duration of 13 hours 25 minutes from Los Angeles. American Airlines, United, Alaska Airlines and KLM also fly this route.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;All these airlines run an excellent full-service option with first class and business class seats. The comfort, d&#38;eacute;cor and meal options are vastly superior to what is offered to passengers flying coach.&#60;/p&#62;

</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;h3&#62;Why Visit Portugal?&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Portugal is the quiet wallflower of Western Europe, all refined, restrained substance in the face of its tourism megastar neighbors of England, France, Italy and Spain. Behind that serene facade is a country with:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;a rich history which goes back older than that of others in the region;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;a penchant for lively colors and vibrant celebrations;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;a varied, enthralling geography;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;a great cuisine;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;a warm people molded by their fantastic surrounds.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The west coast of Portugal is a long stretch of pristine beaches washed by the warm waters of the Atlantic. It is peppered with amazing rock formations that seem to have been crafted with purposeful beauty.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The Serra de Arrabida mountain range is a UNESCO-protected site that offers a simple return to nature amidst stunning landscapes. There are hot springs, caves and valleys, all created by the upheaval in the Earth that resulted in volcanic activity.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The Portuguese love their food and will make a believer out of you, too. For lovers of seafood, the stretches of coast mean Europe&#38;#8217;s largest fishing zone and, consequently, the lowest prices on all food from the ocean.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;They love their drink, too, especially beer, and will willingly oblige to help you see things their way in this respect. The nightlife in Portuguese cities rivals that of major cities around the world and the partying carries on well into the night (and next morning!).&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Some of Portugal&#38;#39;s wine consistently receive top marks from international oenophiles and the local wine industry has developed well beyond just port.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Many visitors to Portugal are shocked at how affordable it is to get an authentic European experience, the likes of which easily cost double right across the border.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Must See Cities in Portugal&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/city/to-lisbon-lis&#34;&#62;Lisbon&#60;/a&#62; - as the largest and most populous city, the nation&#38;#39;s capital bound by seven hills has been witness to many a significant Portuguese event.&#38;#160; Monuments to many of these and others can be found in Baxia and Alfama.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Baxia was one of the first world cities to be designed in a grid layout; Alfama is much older and more haphazard, but both have their fair share of history and character. The Lisbon Castle, Se Cathedral and Saint Anthony&#38;#39;s Church are magnificent examples of Portuguese architectural ingenuity.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Belem district contains more historical monuments than you could cover in a day. The beautiful Mosteiro dos Jeronimos monastery and Torre de Belem fort which sits in the sea are tourist favorites.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Porto - famous for its towering lookouts called &#38;#39;miradouros&#38;#39;, lodge cellars called &#38;#39;azulejos&#38;#39; and bright street art, Porto&#38;#39;s beautifully flat skyline is broken by tall bell towers and exquisitely intricate churches.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Take a tram ride up to Foz do Douro and savor the fantastic view of the gorgeous ocean. See the Jardim do Pal&#38;aacute;cio de Cristal for its beautiful layout of gardens and fountains. Porto is a foodie&#38;#39;s dream, with the freshest seafood the most affordable anywhere in Europe.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;Sintra - the magical-sounding name of this UNESCO World Heritage-listed city is very apt. From the verdant mountains on the east to the serene Atlantic on the west and everything in between, Sintra is simply stunning.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The colorful amalgamation of shapes and colors that is the Pena Palace is one of the most popular sights to see and explore. Its position at the very top of a hill gives you spectacular uninterrupted views as far as the eye can see. Other ancient ruins, medieval palaces and enthralling architecture abound.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Flight Characteristics&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;There are many direct flights from the United States to Portugal from Newark Airport on the east coast. Most flights from the west coast of the U.S. have one stop and transit through major European cities like Madrid and &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/city/to-rome-fco&#34;&#62;Rome&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;From Newark, a flight to Lisbon takes just under 7 hours, and you can fly US airways, Air Canada and Hawaiian Airlines, among others. From New York, the shortest flight will cover the distance of over 5,000 kilometers in just under 10 hours. Delta Airlines plies this route with a layover at Madrid.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;United Airlines has the shortest flight duration from the western United States, transporting passengers from San Francisco to Lisbon in just over 13 hours with a layover at Newark Airport.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;First and business class passengers enjoy great food and drink, excellent rest and superior attention on full-service airlines from the U.S. to Portugal.&#60;/p&#62;

</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;h3&#62;Why Visit Croatia?&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;There are not many ex-Communist bloc countries that have so quickly and so radically embraced openness and commerce and tourism like Croatia has. If, when you visit, the scenery and landscape seems familiar, it won&#38;#39;t be deja vu - Croatia is the permanent setting for many episodes of the TV series &#38;#39;Game of Thrones&#38;#39;.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The young, hip population, hordes of travelers and the hedonistic approach to life has Croatia earn the title of the &#38;#39;New Ibiza&#38;#39;. The weather is excellent for outdoor festivals and music fests with live DJs and international artists are being held increasingly frequently.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The producers of Game of Thrones decided on Croatia because it offers such a wondrous set of sights of every kind. The water of the Adriatic Sea is cerulean blue from afar and crystal clear on close-up. The towering mountains of the Dinaric Alps and verdant forests provide an ethereal landscape within which to lose yourself.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The coastline is dotted with small island, many of which are worth a day trip unto themselves. Croatian beaches are gaining immense popularity for their beauty, serenity and cleanliness. The geography of the land makes it ideal for any number of outdoor sports. Hiking and biking are just ordinary - try your hand at:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;ziplining;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;abseiling;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;rock climbing;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;white water rafting.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Croatian cuisine is delicious in itself but has been enhanced even further by a dash of cosmopolitan from international restaurateurs. The locally-grown and -produced wine rivals many a top drop from more established countries.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Must See Cities in Croatia&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The nation has a rich historical story, something that is communicated by the vast ancient ruins from the Roman and Byzantine eras, as well as medieval ones.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h4&#62;Dubrovnik&#60;/h4&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Facing the Adriatic Sea, &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/city/to-dubrovni-dbv&#34;&#62;Dubrovnik&#60;/a&#62; is renowned for the architecture and distinctive look of its Old Town.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Walking the City Walls has become almost as synonymous with Dubrovnik as the Great Wall of China is in that country. The route gives you fantastic views of the layout and scenery below and beyond and is a great way to get your bearings before you start exploring. For even better views, take the cable car to Mount Srd. A bastion of defense against the Turk invasions, its battlements still stand strong.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Banje Beach is a great place to unwind and people watch whether you are travelling alone or with family or friends. The waters are gorgeous and just nice for most of the year, and the beach is sand, pebble and shingle in parts.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h4&#62;Zagreb&#60;/h4&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Fancy a look at the aftermath of relationship breakdowns, poignant, hilarious and weird as they may be? Then, you should wander into Zagreb&#38;#39;s Museum of broken Relationships. Featuring the remains of ended loves, every component is a donation from a very, very glad or very confused person from around the globe.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The Museum of Contemporary Art is spread across 17,000 square meters and showcases hundreds of modern works of display art. It also features performance art, films and concerts throughout the year.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The unbelievably-green Maksimir Park is great for a stroll.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;h4&#62;Split&#60;/h4&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Croatia&#38;#39;s second-largest city is a mix of modern bars and restaurants, and the country&#38;#39;s ancient heritage.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;UNESCO World Heritage-listed Diocletian&#38;#39;s Palace should not be missed. These Roman-era ruins are a mixture of a fort and palace and is Split&#38;#39;s biggest attraction. Egyptian sphinxes and columns of exquisite Italian marble grace the sprawling grounds.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;St. Dominus Cathedral is one of the most well-preserved remnants of the Roman empire still standing. Its unique octagonal design is surrounded by additions made through the ages - friezes, columns, sculptures and statues that are a wonder to explore.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Flight Characteristics&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;There are no direct flights from the United State to Croatia, and travelers will need to make at least one stop. From the eastern U.S., the flight time is just under 10 hours if you fly from New York and layover in Frankfurt. This option is provided by Lufthansa.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;From the western seaboard, Lufthansa has a flight to Zagreb that also transits through Frankfurt. It takes slightly over 13 hours to land in Croatia after flying from Los Angeles.&#60;/p&#62;

</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;h3&#62;Why Visit Indonesia?&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Sprawling across Southeast Asia, Indonesia is a vast nation with innumerable unique experiences waiting to be discovered. While most people associate only the island of Bali with tourism in Indonesia, the country has a wealth of culture, history and natural wonders for a traveler to get lost in.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The name &#38;#39;Indonesia&#38;#39; originates from &#38;#39;India&#38;#39; and alludes to the influence from the subcontinent that shaped much of Indonesia&#38;#39;s history and culture, and continues to make its presence felt today in everyday life, traditions and the arts.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Some of Indonesia&#38;#39;s most important and famous tourist attractions are remnants of this heritage - Central Java&#38;#39;s Borobudur, the world&#38;#39;s largest Buddhist complex, and UNESCO World Heritage-listed Prambanan Temple are ideal examples.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Indonesia&#38;#39;s capacity to absorb a myriad of influences has created a diverse cuisine that runs the gamut of palates. Many dishes that are basically the same and even have the same name can vary significantly, depending on where in Indonesia you sample it, as locals swap ingredients for what is most readily available.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The waters off Indonesia are home to a vast variety of marine life. Scattered across them are pristine dive sites famous the world over for the ethereal window they give of life beneath the waves. If you prefer your action on the waves instead, Indonesia boasts some of Asia&#38;#39;s best surfing crests, too.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;If wildlife is your thing, unique experiences await you in Indonesia - come face to face with orangutans on Borneo&#38;#39;s Kalimantan state and Komodo Dragons on the island of Komodo.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Indonesia is home to 150 volcanoes, the most famous being Mt. Bromo.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Must See Cities in Indonesia&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Being so vast, Indonesia has a number of cities that should be on your list to fully understand the diverse nation. Here are a few of the best.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The only Hindu area in the majority-muslim nation, Bali has retained much of its ancient Indian heritage that it shares with the world today. Some of the world&#38;#8217;s most beautiful Hindu temples live on in Bali. Uluwatu Temple and Tanah Lot are perfect examples, built on and near the water to add spectacular views to your spiritual journey.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Across, in Chinatown, the beautiful Sam Poo Kong temple dating to the 1400s is a perennial tourist draw. The Great Mosque and Dome Church Blenduk round off the religious diversity here.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Bali &#38;ndash; technically, Bali is an island, we know. However, there is so much jam-packed into this small area that it earned a place here.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Semarang - set on the north coast of Java island, Semarang offers a glimpse back into Indonesia&#38;#39;s Dutch colonial heritage. The Dutch East India Company&#38;#39;s headquarters was in the massive building complex of Lawang Sewu.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Yogyakarta - also on Java, Yogyakarta is world-renowned for the Borobudur temple complex and the Prambanan Temple grounds. Visit them and be amazed at how people&#38;#39;s beliefs inspired them to create wonderful monuments to their faith using ancient technology.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Jakarta &#38;ndash; the nation&#38;#8217;s capital is home to the Indonesian National Museum (a natural history museum) and the Wayang Museum (which focuses on puppets and dolls used in traditional storytelling).&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Flight Characteristics&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The U.S. to Indonesia journey is a long one and there are no direct flights available. Many carriers offer a single-stop journey that helps to break up the journey which takes just over 22 hours.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Qatar Airways flies from New York to Jakarta with a layover at their base in Doha. From Los Angeles, the shortest flight is operated by American Airlines. It takes 21 hours and has a layover at Japan&#38;#39;s Narita Airport.&#60;/p&#62;

</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;h3&#62;Why Visit Lithuania?&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Lithuania? Where is that?&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Ahhh, if only they knew. The Republic of Lithuania sits on the Baltic Sea&#38;#39;s southeastern shore and offers some of the most affordable getaways in Europe.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Some of Lithuania&#38;#39;s most memorable destinations are related to its history of religion. The Hill of Crosses, the Museum of Devils and the Hill of Witches should arouse the interest of anyone interested in understanding the evolution of beliefs.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;It is home to the UNESCO World Heritage-listed Curonian Spit, a massive sand dune that keeps the waters of the Curonian and Baltic Seas apart. For those interested, there are three other such sites in Lithuania - the Struve Geodetic Arc, The Kerave Archaeological site and the historic center of the nation&#38;#39;s capital, Vilnius.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;For architectural history buffs, Lithuania is a wonderland for its neoclassical buildings. For others, Zemaitija National Park&#38;#39;s decommissioned Soviet nuclear missile base might be the real draw.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;There are other remnants of, and memorials to, the country&#38;#39;s tumultuous history. The Museum of Genocide victims and the Vilna Gaon Jewish State Museum attest to the brutality suffered by all Lithuanians and Jewish Lithuanians respectively.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Lithuania has a quirky sense of humor, if a country can have one. You will find trees wearing sweaters, visit the self-declared &#38;#39;Republic of Uzupis&#38;#39; inside Vilnius and see road signs with smileys and the Mona Lisa. There is also a family park built to resemble a Siberian Soviet concentration camp, complete with statues of communist stalwarts like Stalin and Lenin.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Definitely worth a look.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Must See Cities in Lithuania&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Vilnius &#38;ndash; the nation&#38;#8217;s capital is chock full of surprises for the traveler. From the aforementioned quirky state humor to the most affordable price tags of any European capital, Vilnius definitely entertains on a budget. There are also many interesting places outside the capital:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Just outside the capital lies the tragic Paneriai Forest, where countless Jews were murdered. It is a poignant site.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;The Saint Peter and Paul Church is famous for its collection of over 2,000 statues.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;&#38;Scaron;iauliai - essential viewing, if only for the Hill of Crosses. There are too many thousands of crosses here to count (close to two million by estimates), and added to every day as newlywed couples and pilgrims leave their own. Look closer - many have a story etched into them.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Trakai - less than 30 km from Vilnius, this city is home to the Trakai Historical National Park. The centerpiece is a beautiful medieval castle in the middle of a blue lake. There are balloon tours to give you the best view. If you venture below, you can cross the footbridge between the lake&#38;#39;s islands.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Neringa &#38;ndash; this seaside resort is home to the Curonian Spit which is worth a visit on its own. However, not far from the Spit is the Hill of Witches, an outdoor sculpture gallery. The subject of this gallery is the nation&#38;#8217;s pagan past and features some intricately-created pieces which inspire a combination of intrigue and horror.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Flight Characteristics&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;There are no direct flights between the United States and Lithuania, and the best option for travelers is a single-stop connecting flight. The fastest of these from New York on the east coast is operated by British Airways. It completes the journey in just over 10 hours, including a layover in Helsinki, Finland.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;From the west coast, several airlines offer single-stop trips that transit through various European airports and are exceedingly long. It is probably better to take a domestic flight to New York and board the British Airways flight from there.&#60;/p&#62;

</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;h3&#62;Why Visit Montenegro?&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;A name which translates into as dramatic a phrase as &#38;#39;Black Mountain&#38;#39; deserves the personality to match. Here, Montenegro does not disappoint.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Set on the southern coast of Europe, looking out onto the Adriatic Sea, the nation has been at the crossroads of empires and has the history to match. The Venetians, Italians, Turks and the Communists have all had their opportunity to rule and Montenegro has broken free, proud and independent, every time.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;It has shed the memories of the Yugoslav upheaval of the 1990s and rebuilt its tourism industry to attract over 1.6 million visitors a year, three times the number of its own population.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The perennial draw of Montenegro is both its natural beauty and its vibrant history. Beautiful sights of water, coast, plains and mountains abound to snare the attention of the romantics. Majestic forts, imposing walled towns, Roman mosaics and ornate Orthodox Christian churches will enthrall history buffs and architecture enthusiasts.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The Montenegrin terrain is an outdoor lover&#38;#39;s wonderland, perfect as it is for all manner of activities including hiking, biking, kayaking and horseback riding. The cool forests are still the lairs of wolves and homes of bears.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Montenegro has made a concerted effort to reinvent itself as a cosmopolitan tourism destination with heart. The remnants of its history are well-maintained and carefully preserved while new bars and restaurants are allowed to thrive to appeal more widely to visitors.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Must See Cities in Montenegro&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Montenegro can be divided into five regions, each with its own unique draw. Here is a list of one city from each region for a rounded view of the best places to see around the nation:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Kotor - the Bay of Kotor has earned itself a spot on the UNESCO World Heritage List for the sites of Perast and Kotor. The latter is exquisite almost without compare but its appeal is more than aesthetic. The Town Walls, River and Sea Gates, St. Tryphon&#38;#39;s Cathedral and the maritime Museum of Montenegro are perfect places to discover the heart and soul of this resilient nation.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Budva - the central coast&#38;#39;s Budva Riviera seems to be modeled on the upscale coastal promenades that are so popular across Western Europe. Budva has garnered immense attention for its thrilling bar and club scene as well as the gorgeous beaches.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Podgorica - the capital of the country lies at the southeastern end of the Central Montenegro region and is home to almost a third of the population. The thousand-year old St. George Church, the intriguing architecture of the Holy Heart of Jesus Church and the Millennium Bridge over the Moraca River await.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Bar - the most interesting destination in the Southern Coast region is the Bar Old Town, which is home to many ancient ruins that speak of the country&#38;#39;s history. It is also the location of the world&#38;#39;s oldest olive tree, which has been dated to between 2,000 and 2,500 years of age.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;North Montenegro - this mountainous region is where the winter capital of Zabljak lies on the side of Mount Durmitor. Zabljak is covered in snow for almost four months in a year, making it an ideal winter getaway. When the snow thaws, rafting, mountaineering, cycling and hiking become the activities of choice to take in the amazing scenery.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Flight Characteristics&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;There are no direct flights from the United States to Montenegro and there will be at least one stop regardless of from where you fly.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The shortest flight time for flights from the east coast are by My Austrian Airlines which completes the journey in 14 hours 30 minutes. From the west coast, the shortest flight time to Montenegro is achieved by Aeroflot which lands there 17 hours after its departure. The stops are at &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/city/to-vienna-vie&#34;&#62;Vienna&#60;/a&#62; and &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/city/to-moscow-dme&#34;&#62;Moscow&#60;/a&#62; respectively.&#60;/p&#62;

</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;h3&#62;Why Visit Poland?&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Who would have thought that Poland is the 16th&#38;#160;most visited country in the world?&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Yes, this unassuming Eastern European country that sits on the shores of the Baltic Sea is proving itself to be a fantastic tourist destination. Its medieval heritage shines through amazing architecture while its modern persona is on display with its bustling major cities.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Poland was, unfortunately, the setting for many traumatic chapters of the Second World War. The belated silver lining is that the country is committed to remembering the sacrifices of its people and the hardships they underwent through a number of permanently-protected sites that have become immensely popular.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Her clean air, open spaces, good food and wonderful people are all the welcome you need.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Must-See Cities in Poland&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Like much of eastern Europe, Poland has a rich heritage of magnificent architecture and monuments. If you are short on exploring time, these two cities should not be missed:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Warsaw &#38;ndash; Poland&#38;#8217;s capital is a patchwork of buildings and monuments from the nation&#38;#8217;s rich and turbulent history. Soviet-era minimalist blocks, modern skyscrapers, Gothic churches and neoclassical palaces share the space. The Chopin Museum, POLIN Jewish history museum, remnants of medieval structures and pulsating nightlife all contribute to its eclectic magnetism.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Krakow - The biggest draw in Southern Poland, Krakow is built around Rynek Glowny market square that is renowned for its beautiful architecture. The 14th century St. Mary&#38;#39;s Basilica and Wieliczka Salt Mine with its underground network of chambers and cathedrals are another major draw. The Auschwitz concentration camp and Oskar Schindler&#38;#39;s factory have always attracted legions of visitors.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;h3&#62;Flight Characteristics&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Okecie Airport is the nation&#38;#39;s largest airport and many major international carriers fly there. There are, however, no direct flights from the continental United States to Poland. Several carriers do offer a single-stop flight, usually laying over at France&#38;#39;s Charles de Gaulle Airport.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The shortest flight time, including time spent in transit, is 10 hours 25 minutes. This option is offered by the U.S.-based carrier, Delta Airlines.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Air travel on long-distance routes can wear you down, regardless of whether you are traveling for business or pleasure. It can leave you less inclined and less able to enjoy the sights and sounds of your destination.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;But if you are flying in a first class or a business class seat, you might not even notice the flight duration. Wider seats with better cushioning and horizontal recline are perfect for the body. Meanwhile, excellent dining options, premium liquors and personalized service pander to your soul.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Why buy tickets with I Fly First Class?&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;I Fly First Class has perfected the combination of luxury travel and cheap fare costs. We also have the reach and expertise to help you obtain last minute tickets from the U.S.A. to any destination worldwide.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;With cheap prices and extravagant travel guaranteed, why would you not choose I Fly First Class?&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;How to find tickets on I Fly First Class&#60;/h3&#62;

</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;h3&#62;Why Visit the U.A.E.?&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Not very long ago, the United Arab Emirates was but an insignificant speck in the desert. Revenue from the oil industry has transformed this otherwise parched desert nation of 7 emirates into a global center for tourism.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Tourists love the ever-changing skyline and the continuous array of new wonders that seem to pop up every few months.&#38;#160; No trip to the U.A.E. is ever the same if the developers can help it.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The U.A.E. government is driven and committed in its pursuit of becoming a worldwide hub of business and trade as well as leisure. Many of the world&#38;#8217;s largest firms have been lured here by the tax-free incentives the country offers.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Must-See Cities in U.A.E.&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;There are 3 major cities not to miss:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Abu Dhabi &#38;ndash; The capital of the U.A.E. is situated in the emirate of Dubai, which is sometimes mistaken for a nation on its own. Abu Dhabi is the site of the world&#38;#8217;s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa. The Abu Dhabi Heritage Village offers a great insight into what life was like here before the discovery of oil.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Sharjah &#38;ndash; Considered the nation&#38;#8217;s cultural capital, Sharjah shows off its arab heritage through restored buildings and museums. The Sharjah Aquarium and Blue Souk, which is home to over 600 stores, should be on your itinerary.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Fujairah &#38;ndash; Fujairah Fort and Fujairah Museum are perennial tourist draws, and the latter houses artifacts from the area&#38;#8217;s pre-Islamic era.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;h3&#62;Flight Characteristics&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Spending many long hours in an aeroplane can seem like a daunting chore, even if you are on the way to the U.A.E. However, where you sit on the plane can turn that chore into an experience that you want to relive over and over.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;First class and business class passengers get the very best personalized service, superior dining options (including custom-made creations by renowned chefs), access to the best entertainment and seats that feel more like hotel beds.&#60;/p&#62;

</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;h3&#62;Why Visit Sri Lanka?&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Situated just off the southern tip of India, this pearl of the Indian Ocean is a largely undiscovered treasure of beauty and experiences. The diverse landscape of this island nation ranges from white sand beaches to humid rainforests to undulating highlands.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Its Buddhist heritage is on display across several ancient ruins dating back millennia. Sri Lanka is a modern, developing nation with much in store for you to discover.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Must-See Cities in Sri Lanka&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Colombo &#38;ndash; The giant Buddha is the unmistakable indication that you are in the Sri Lanka&#38;#8217;s capital. Successive influences &#38;ndash; Portuguese, Dutch and British &#38;ndash; are evident from its historical architecture. It has:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;a vibrant nightlife;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;massive shopping complexes;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;a skyline of skyscrapers.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Kandy &#38;ndash; Situated in central Sri Lanka on a plateau surrounded by tea plantations and rainforests, Kandy is the nation&#38;#8217;s religious heart. The Temple of the Tooth, named for its possession of one of the Buddha&#38;#8217;s teeth is an iconic pilgrimage site for international visitors.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Flight Characteristics&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Air travel has lost the aura of prestige it once held. That is, if you still choose to travel coach. In first class and business class, on the other hand, the aura is as bright as ever.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;From exclusive lounges at the airport which offer amenities like massages and enclosed personal waiting areas besides preferred boarding privileges, the luxury of the experience begins even before you step on your plane.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;On board, extra-wide seats which recline into beds, large personal entertainment screens, selected fine dining options and superior liquor are all part of the flight experience. Proper cutlery, not flimsy plastic, allow you to savor your meal as it was meant to be enjoyed.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;Noise-cancelling headphones tune out the drone of the aircraft so you can enjoy the latest blockbuster or classical musical notes in their true form.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;All the opulence and indulgence is complemented by service that leaves no stone unturned.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Why buy tickets with I Fly First Class?&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Who doesn&#38;#8217;t want the best deal on air fares? That is precisely what I Fly First Class offers every client.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;But our service does not stop at simply finding tickets with the lowest charges &#38;ndash; we also source last minute seats when all others tell you there are none left. When you book through us, you get the assurance of cheap flights combined with the thrill of luxurious international travel in first class or business class.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;How to find tickets on I Fly First Class&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;I Fly First Class is the complete travel concierge which you can access at your convenience, all day, every day and throughout the year.&#38;#160; We offer you three easy options through which you can simply tell us what you need and have us do all the work for you.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;If you need immediate attention, the best option is to call us at our direct toll-free number: 1-800-385-1359 in the U.S.A.&#38;#160; A travel specialist will attend to you and provide all the assistance you require.&#60;/p&#62;

</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;h3&#62;Why Visit Slovenia?&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;This beautiful central European country is a winter wonderland that is just as gorgeous through all the other months of the year, too. It has developed rapidly in recent years, with modern buildings taking up space beside Renaissance-era ones.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Nature is one of Slovenia&#38;#8217;s biggest draws and her scenery from aquamarine lakes to verdant green highlands and white sand beaches combine to make a mosaic of visual treats.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Must-See Cities in Slovenia&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Ljubljana &#38;ndash; The largest city of Slovenia is also its capital. Ljubljana is not only a pleasure to pronounce but a pleasure to tour, with its vast green spaces and outdoor caf&#38;eacute; culture. Ljubljana Castle is worth a visit, not least for the funicular that visitors can ride up to it.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Bled &#38;ndash; This a holiday getaway renowned for its amazingly picturesque scenes of tranquility. It is home to the Triglav National Park which is a winter skiing paradise, and Bled&#38;#8217;s island Pilgrimage Church which is accessible only by rowboat.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Flight Characteristics&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Has the magic gone out of air travel for you? Do you dread going to the airport? Does the prospect of spending long hours in an airplane unsettle you?&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;If yes, the odds are that you are not travelling in first class or business class. First class and business class travel offer a completely different experience than traveling coach. Every aspect of the journey is transformed with a touch of luxury and the pleasure of personalized service.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;Gone is the flimsy plastic cutlery, the cheap paper or plastic cups are nowhere to be seen and the tacky hardly-audible headphones have disappeared. In their place, you will find fine cutlery, long-stemmed flutes for your champagne, and high-quality headphones from leading companies to enjoy the entertainment.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The entertainment itself is in a league of its own. Most first class seats feature personal screens as large as 23 inches so you can immerse yourself in a golden oldie or the latest Hollywood hit.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Why buy tickets with I Fly First Class?&#60;/h3&#62;

</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;h3&#62;Why Visit Luxembourg?&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;This tiny, landlocked western European country is charmingly underdeveloped compared to its neighbors France, Belgium and &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/country/to-germany&#34; title=&#34;first class deals to Germany&#34;&#62;Germany&#60;/a&#62;. It features tight, neat architecture in its capital, also named Luxembourg, and wonderfully green undulating hills almost everywhere else.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;A visit to Luxembourg is probably the easiest way to imagine what Europe would be like without the overpopulation, pollution and general chaos.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Must-See Cities in Luxembourg&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Tourists tend to visit the following cities:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Luxembourg &#38;ndash; The Palace of the Grand Duke, dating to the 1500s and the Notre Dame Cathedral with its Gothic architecture should not be missed. Also worth a look are the MUDAM museum of modern art and the American Cemetery which is the last resting place of the famed World War 2 general, George S. Patton, Jr.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Esch-sur-Alzette &#38;ndash; This is the nation&#38;#8217;s second-largest city, with a grand total of less than 35,000 residents. The National Museum of Resistance, dating back to the Second World War, the Lankelz miniature railway, and the nation&#38;#8217;s longest shopping strip can all be found here.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Flight Characteristics&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;On a long haul flight, the ability to stretch your legs and move about is one of the most important factors in how you feel when you arrive at your destination. With airlines squeezing more seats onto aircraft, it is impossible to find the personal space you require while traveling in economy class.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;On the other hand, first class and business class travel is only getting more luxurious as airlines compete for elite clientele who appreciate the finer things in life.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The result is premium class travel that outshines anything that has been offered in the air before. Some carriers offer completely enclosed suites on board which feature beds that are large enough to lie on, spread-eagle.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;The best airlines offer a &#38;lsquo;choose your chef&#38;#8217; service where travelers can make their selections from an a la carte menu before they travel and have an accomplished chef create a personal masterpiece of culinary delight for the journey.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Why buy tickets with I Fly First Class?&#60;/h3&#62;

</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;h3&#62;Why Visit Israel?&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Israel is an enigma; she is the world&#38;#8217;s only Jewish state, the site of the origin of religions followed by billions of people across the planet, and a modern, sophisticated society in a neighborhood which does not seem at all conducive to that reality.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Much of the tiny nation&#38;#8217;s status as a major tourist destination can be attributed to the fact that its lands are the setting for many of the events of the both the Bible and the Torah. However, apart from religious pilgrimage, Israel is a world center for thought, innovation, creativity and humanity.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;It attracts and welcomes people from across the globe that share its philosophy and has a beautifully diverse and energetic population which make every visit to the Holy Land a wonderful experience.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Must-See Cities in Israel&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Tel Aviv &#38;ndash; The history-rich atmosphere is accentuated by a modern populace that reveres tradition but also loves to party. The Palmach Museum, Diaspora Museum and Tel Aviv Museum of Art can occupy your daytime while its endless stretch of clubs and bars will claim the night.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Jerussalem &#38;ndash; The Church of the Holy Sepulchre is the holiest site in Christianity and a destination of pilgrimage for both Christians and inquisitive people the world over. The Yad Vashem memorial to the six million Jews killed in the Holocaust alone is worth spending a day here.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Flight Characteristics&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Traveling by air on short-haul flights can be bad enough, but long-haul flights have the tendency to worsen jet lag and leave you unable to enjoy the first day or even days of your dream holiday. Minimize the odds of squandering the wonder of new discovery by choosing to travel in the luxury of first class or business class.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;Even though you are on the same plane, travel in premier class means that you will have:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;access to more personal space;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;better quality of food and drinks;&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;personalized service.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;That, in combination, make for a much better journey.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Seats in first and business class on most airlines are able to lie flat so you can get the rest that you want and be fresh for when you step off the plane at the end of your flight.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Why buy tickets with I Fly First Class?&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;When you choose I Fly First Class, you are choosing the premier first class and business class seat procurement concierge.&#60;/p&#62;

</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;h3&#62;Why Visit Finland?&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;One of the world&#38;#8217;s northernmost countries, Finland is one of the best places to get a glimpse of the amazing Aurora Borealis. Her amazing landscape is largely untouched, a paradise for the nature lover while its fun, hip and friendly people will make you want to keep coming back.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Must-See Cities in Finland&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Helsinki &#38;ndash; The central avenue of Mannerheimintie is where a lot of the action is in Helsinki &#38;ndash; the National Museum which house artifacts from the Stone Age; Kiasma, a modern art museum; and parliament House can all be found here. Temmpeliaukio is a church carved into bedrock that also functions as a concert venue.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Rovaniemi &#38;ndash; This one is for the kids &#38;ndash; the &#38;lsquo;official&#38;#8217; home of Santa Claus, and it has a toy shop and an igloo hotel. Rovaniemi is also the best places in Finland to view the Northern Lights.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Turku &#38;ndash; Turku Castle is also a museum of medieval Finnish history. The Handicrafts Museum harks back to a simpler time before the Industrial Age when so much effort went into every item humans produced.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Flight Characteristics&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Many consider the golden age of air travel to be over, gone with the times when terrorism hadn&#38;#8217;t cast its shadow and a flight attendant was considered almost as glamorous as a model. However, stiff competition between airlines for premium air travelers is reinventing the experience in ways unimaginable till recently.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;First class and business class passengers are spoiled with a wide array of amenities and little luxuries that rival experiences on the ground. First class airline suites with large beds, buffet meals 30,000 feet in the air, and celebrity chef-prepared meals served a la carte are just a small cross-section of what to expect.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The entire flight experience is made even more special with attentive personal service from the flight attendants and usually includes amenity kits by prominent designers that travelers may retain.&#60;/p&#62;

</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;h3&#62;Why Visit Denmark?&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Denmark is a remarkable country - it consistently ranks as the world&#38;#39;s least corrupt, best educated, most democratic, most prosperous country as well as the one with the best healthcare.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;It also holds the honor, dubious or otherwise, of being the world&#38;#39;s first country to legalize pornography. In the diametrically opposite direction, Denmark was also home to Hans Christian Andersen, famous for his fairy tales.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Must-See Cities in Denmark&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Copenhagen &#38;ndash; The capital of Denmark is home to the royal palaces of Amalienborg and Christiansborg as well as the Rosenborg Place which dates back to the Renaissance era. The Tivoli amusement park and Hans Christian Andersen&#38;#8217;s &#38;lsquo;Little mermaid&#38;#8217; sculpture are among the must-see sites of the city.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Billund &#38;ndash; Billund is home to the Lego head office, largest factory and the first Legoland theme park, which makes it a major attraction for people young and old.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Bornholm &#38;ndash; This is an island off the Danish coast that is home to the medieval Hammershus castle, built atop a cliff. Dueodde beach is a popular getaway for Danes and the Bornholm Butterfly Park is ideal for lovers of flora and fauna.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Flight Characteristics&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;If you have decided that economy class travel is not worth the discomfort when you consider the minimal cost savings, you are on the right track.&#38;#160; First class and business class travel gives you an entirely different experience, both in-flight and before you board.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;From access to premium lounges at airports in the U.S. and around the world where you can rest, relax, eat, drink and even shower and sleep to the unparalleled comforts and amazing personal service in the skies, first class and business class reservations are your golden tickets to a world of new and delightful experiences.&#60;/p&#62;

</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;h3&#62;Why Visit Bulgaria?&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Bulgaria is a Balkan nation of diverse landscapes, one that is developing an increasing modern outlook and the skyline to go with that, while retaining its rich cultural heritage and the monuments and relics that hark to that aspect of her character.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;From vast ski fields that provide some of the best winter vacation spots in the region to smooth, wide beaches bordering the aquamarine sea, Bulgaria&#38;#8217;s landscape of contrasts is a world waiting to be discovered.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Must-See Cities in Bulgaria&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Sofia &#38;ndash; This city retains relics of its history of occupation by the Greeks, Romans and Turks. The St. George Rotunda Church built by Romans in the 4th&#38;#160;century and the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral which commemorates Russian soldiers killed in the Russo-Turkish War are visitor favorites. The National Archaeological Museum&#38;#8217;s Thracian burial mask made of gold is another.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Varna &#38;ndash; The Varna Aquarium and nearby Dolphinarium are the biggest draws of this seaside city. For history buffs, the Naval Museum&#38;#8217;s Drazki warship which defeated Turkish forces might be the way to spend the day.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Flight Characteristics&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;There is no doubt that traveling first class or business class affords a far superior experience in every respect when compared to flying coach.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Air travel, particularly on long distance flights can take its toll on both the body and the mind; flying in premier class helps alleviate a lot of the discomfort that can contribute to jet lag and even serious conditions like deep vein thrombosis (DVT).&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;One of the obvious differences is that of seating. First class and business class seats are wider, longer and better cushioned than those in economy. More legroom is available and armrests are wider, creating a wider radius of personal space.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;There is a stark difference in the quality of the meals and drinks served; some carriers even offer buffets during certain flights while others allow travelers to book chef-created meals before they board.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Why buy tickets with I Fly First Class?&#60;/h3&#62;

</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;h3&#62;Why Visit Austria?&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;If you are a connoisseur of classical music, Austria will probably have your unending gratitude for giving the world two of history&#38;#8217;s greatest composers, Mozart and Beethoven.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;For outdoor sports buffs, its ski fields cater to families, beginner and experts while the glorious summer vistas featured most famously in the classic &#38;lsquo;The Sound of Music&#38;#8217; need no introduction. If you are an automobile fan, there is also the world&#38;#8217;s largest Rolls Royce museum to explore.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Must-See Cities in Austria&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Vienna &#38;ndash; Mozart, Beethoven and Sigmund Freud were all born here. There is an entire Quarter dedicated to the arts, and works from artists both contemporary and classical. The Spanish Riding School&#38;#8217;s Lipizzaner stallions are a sight to behold.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Salzburg &#38;ndash; The DomQuartier is home to a 17th&#38;#160;century cathedral that houses a 4,000-pipe organ. The Renaissance Hellbrunn Palace grounds and the city zoo are tranquil getaways with ample open space and picnic areas.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Flight Characteristics&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The luxury of first class and business class travel has to be experienced to be fully appreciated. It is more than just wider seats that become fully-flat beds in the air; it is more than gourmet food and drink while cruising at 30,000 feet; and it is more than access to premium lounges at airports all over the world.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;There is no substitute for the personal touch in the care that you enjoy from everyone &#38;ndash; ground crew at check-in, lounge staff, and the flight attendants. It is the difference that you feel when you taste a meal in the air that matches one you would find at an elite restaurant.&#60;/p&#62;

Budapest is the national capital and home to 118 mineral baths. The Budapest History Museum showcases artifacts dating back to the Roman era.

    &#60;p&#62;Szeged &#38;ndash; The Szeged Open Air Festival was first held in 1931 and continues to be celebrated every May. The double spires of the Votive Church, the Ferenc Mora Museum and 330-year old Saint Nicholas Serbian Orthodox Church are a great example of the diversity of Hungary&#38;#8217;s architecture as well as historical monuments in their own right.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Eger &#38;ndash; Eger was one of the last bastions of the Turks before they were driven out of Europe. Now, the only remnant of that time is a single minaret while the castle of Eger which defended against the invasion.

</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;h3&#62;Why Visit Czech Republic?&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Situated pretty much right in the very center of the European continent, the Czech Republic has been at the crossroads of civilization for a long time and absorbed a little bit of it all into its own character. It is also the perfect launch pad for jaunts to every corner of Europe.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;From wines to beers, from tall snowy mountains to deep, gigantic caves, it offers a little of everything to everyone. Cuisine-wise, a visit to the Czech Republic is a reintroduction to almost every conceivable variation of pork and of beer possible.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Must-See Cities in Czech Republic&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Prague - The nickname &#38;lsquo;City of a Hundred Spires&#38;#8217; is a testament to Prague&#38;#8217;s traditional status as a bastion of Christianity. The Baroque buildings and gothic churches that border the Old Town Square give it a colorful and tranquil serenity. Visit the Old New Synagogue, the world&#38;#8217;s oldest active synagogue. Prague Castle, originally built over 1,200 years ago is the seat of power today.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Brno - The Technical Museum focuses on ancient and modern discoveries from basic music machines to complex electron microscopes. Spilberk Castle&#38;#39;s museum is worth a visit, as is the Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Karlovy Vary - The abundance of natural thermal springs makes this city a popular destination for visitors from around the country and around the world. The Mill Colonnade is famous for its summer concerts. Czechs love hiking and the Ohre Valley offers a variety of escapades, from the easy to the challenging, in that respect.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Flight Characteristics&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;There are several direct flights from the United States to the Czech Republic. The shortest of these is the 8 hours 30 minutes it takes to travel from New York&#38;#8217;s JFK Airport to Prague.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;Spending all those hours cooped up in a plane cabin can be a taxing ordeal&#38;hellip; unless you are traveling in first class or business class. Premier class tickets give you access to enhanced service and additional amenities even before you board the plane. Travelers enjoy free lounge access at airports across the world.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;On board, extra legroom and wider seats that usually fold completely flat allow you to rest and recuperate in luxury. Personal TV screens, some as large as 23 inches paired with high-quality, noise-cancelling headphones allow you to watch TV shows and movies with audio and visual clarity.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The cuisine selection is above par, with some airlines even opting for inflight buffets or chef-created culinary masterpieces you choose yourself prior to boarding.&#60;/p&#62;
