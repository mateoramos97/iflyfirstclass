Millions of people from around the United States and around the world fly in and out of New York every year.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h2 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;Flying out of New York&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;New York is served by three main airports that handle international commercial flights. They are:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;JFK - John F. Kennedy International Airport. JFK has been New York&#38;#8217;s main international airport for many years and handles over 25 million passengers annually. It is located in Queens, at the southern tip of the Van Wyck Expressway. It also handles a number of domestic flights.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;LGA - LaGuardia Airport. Although LGA is primarily a domestic airport, some airlines, like major carrier, Continental Airlines, also use it as an international hub. Close to 13.5 million people passed through LaGuardia last year.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;EWR - Newark International Airport. Newark Airport is situated in Newark, New Jersey and is used by both domestic and international carriers. Its distance from the centre of New York may dissuade travellers short on time but the facilities here are more modern and it is less crowded than both JFK and LGA.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;h2 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;Flying into Hong Kong&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The tiny island of Hong Kong really only has space for a single airport and the honour goes to HKG - Chek Lap Kok Hong Kong International Airport&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Opened in 1998, HKG is now the world&#38;#8217;s eighth-busiest airport by passenger numbers &#38;ndash; over 70.5 million people walked through its gates last year. The airport is located on its own man-made island just off Hong Kong island itself.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h2 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;Why Fly First Class?&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Flying first class is an experience unto itself, and the experience begins even before you board your flight.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Exclusive check-in counters make the start of the airport experience a pleasure. The process is a breeze, handled by your airlines&#38;#8217; best and most adept ground crew. Depending on the airport, you will have access to a premium lounge for all first class and business class passengers or those from your airline only.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The opulent surrounds are enhanced by premium food and drink as you wait to board. First class and business class passengers get priority boarding which makes the transition onto the plane simple and unhurried. On board, the excellent service continues.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Food and drink for first class and business class passengers are a cut above those served to others. The seating is wider and more comfortable. Entertainment options can be better enjoyed because the screens are larger and the headphones are superior.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Rest and relax on seats that recline and lie flat. A direct flight from New York to Hong Kong takes 16 hours &#38;ndash; a premium seat will get you there rested, looking good and feeling better than you have in a long time.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Three international airports serve New York.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;JFK - John F. Kennedy International Airport&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;JFK is virtually synonymous with international travel to New York. It has been the city&#38;#8217;s main international airport for many years and handles over 25 million passengers annually. Located in Queens, at the southern tip of the Van Wyck Expressway, it is also used for a small number of domestic flights.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;LGA - LaGuardia Airport&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;LGA is New York&#38;#8217;s primary domestic airport but is now used by some airlines like Continental as an international hub. Almost 13.5 million people passed through LaGuardia&#38;#8217;s gates in 2016.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;EWR - Newark International Airport&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Situated in Newark, New Jersey, Newark Airport is used by both domestic and international carriers. Its facilities are more modern and it is less crowded than JFK and LGA. However, it is slightly further from the city centre than they are.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h2 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;Flying into Tokyo&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Tokyo is served by two international airports &#38;ndash; Haneda and Narita. Different airlines use one or the other and while the facilities at each are virtually identical, the most important factor in a traveller&#38;#8217;s choice of airports is often the distance of each from Tokyo.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;HND - Haneda Airport&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Haneda Airport is just 15 km from the centre of the city, making it the most convenient stop for anyone short on time. By rail, the commute from Haneda to Tokyo takes just half an hour.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;NRT - Narita Airport&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Narita Airport is situated not in Tokyo, but in Chiba prefecture, 65 km away. A train ride to Tokyo from Narita will take over an hour.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h2 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;Why Fly First Class?&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Please don&#38;#8217;t confuse I Fly First Class with the standard travel concierge - we are so much more.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Our focus is not simply on finding you a premium seat on a flight, we get you that seat even after everyone else has told you they are not available. We find you the lowest prices on first class and business class seats available anywhere.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The shortest flight time from NY to Tokyo is 13 hours 55 minutes. That is an incredibly long time to be stuck in a cramped, hard seat.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;In first and business class, you will have access to more personal space all around &#38;ndash; larger legroom, wider armrests, even an individual cabin on certain airlines. Premium class seats recline completely flat so you will arrive in Tokyo rested and ready for work, play or both.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The food, drink and entertainment options are a world part, too. Good wine, chef-prepared meals, large personal screens and high-quality headphones add to the pleasurable experience.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;You have a choice of three international airports when flying from New York.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;JFK - John F. Kennedy International Airport&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;JFK has been the city&#38;#8217;s main international airport for a quarter of a century and handles over 25 million passengers every year. Located at the southern tip of the Van Wyck Expressway in the district of Queens, it is also a minor hub for domestic flights.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;LGA - LaGuardia Airport&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;LGA is primarily a domestic airport but is also used by airlines like Continental as an international stop. Handling over 13 million passengers in 2016, LaGuardia is a popular choice for those seeking a less busy alternative to JFK.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;EWR - Newark International Airport&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Newark, New Jersey&#38;#8217;s Newark Airport is both a domestic and an international airport. Newer than both JFK and LGA, its facilities are more modern and it is less crowded than either. However, its distance from New York City may deter some passengers on tight schedules.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h2 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;Flying into Seoul&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;There are two airports to choose from.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;ICN - Incheon International Airport&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Rated as the world&#38;#8217;s best airport by Airports Council International every year since 2005, Incheon Airport features a golf course, casino, spa, ice skating rink and private sleeping rooms. It is also consistently ranked the world&#38;#8217;s cleanest airport, the best transit airport and the airport with the best shopping mall.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Almost all international flights arrive at Incheon, which is 48 km from Seoul.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;GMP - Gimpo International Airport&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Located just 15 km west of Seoul, Gimpo is much closer to the city than Incheon. However, it is mainly a domestic airport and only serves international flights between South Korean and Japan, Taiwan and China.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h2 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;Why Fly First Class?&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;It takes at least 14 hours 20 minutes to fly from NY to Seoul. If you have sat in an economy class seat before, you can imagine what an ordeal it will be to be stuck in such a small space for such a long stretch.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;LAX (Los Angeles International Airport) is the name that almost instantly springs to mind when most people think about international travel from Los Angeles. In keeping with this reputation, the airport saw just under 81 million passengers walk through its gates in 2016, making it the busiest (as well as the largest) airport on the western coast of the United States.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;There are three international airports in Los Angeles but LAX is the only one from which one can fly to Hong Kong.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Hong Kong is a small island and its needs are served by a modern, expansive, award-winning airport built on its own island just off Hong Kong - Chek Lap Kok Hong Kong International Airport.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Chek Lap Kok is the world&#38;#8217;s eighth-busiest airport by passenger numbers with close to 71 million passengers in 2016. The HKIA Airport Express links directly to Hong Kong&#38;#8217;s CBD and there are other options ranging from coaches to taxis to limousines conveniently available.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Los Angeles is served by three international airports but only the largest of the trio one handles flights between L.A. and Tokyo &#38;ndash; LAX, Los Angeles International Airport.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;LAX is not only the largest and busiest international airport in Los Angeles, but it is the largest and busiest on the entire western coast of the United States. Last year, almost 81 million passengers flew in or out from LAX.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;You can travel directly to every continent in the world except for Antarctica from LAX. Tokyo is a popular destination with no less than 6 major international carriers flying there.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h2 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;Flying into Tokyo&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Haneda and Narita Airports are the two international airports serving Tokyo. While the facilities at each are virtually identical, the most important factor in a traveller&#38;#8217;s choice of airports is often the distance of each from Tokyo.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Delta Airlines is the only airline that operates out of Los Angeles only to Haneda. United, Singapore Airlines and Japan Airways fly exclusively between Los Angeles and Narita. All Nippon Airways and American Airlines fly to both Haneda and Narita.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;HND - Haneda Airport&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Haneda Airport is just 15 km from the centre of Tokyo city. It is the better option for travellers short on time. The commute from Haneda to Tokyo takes just half an hour by the efficient rail network.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;NRT - Narita Airport&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;While serving Tokyo, Narita Airport is actually situated in Chiba prefecture, 65 km from the capital. It takes at least an hour to travel from Narita to Tokyo by train.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h2 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;Why Fly First Class?&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The shortest direct flights between LA and Tokyo are in the air for almost half of an entire day &#38;ndash; 11 hours and 20 minutes. When you are stuck in a cabin for such a long time, the inflight experience can make a huge difference to how you look and feel when you arrive at your destination.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;It is not a matter simply of the better food and better seats - although a customised chef-prepared meal and double beds that lie flat in your private cabin offered by Singapore Airlines do make a difference. No, it is the entirety of premium service in premium surrounds that leaves you better physically and mentally at the end of your trip.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;With you choose a first class or business class seat, you get that excellent experience every time.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Of the three international airports in Los Angeles, only the biggest handles flights to Asia &#38;ndash; Los Angeles International Airport, better known as LAX.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;One of the most famous names in international aviation, LAX is the busiest airport on the western coast of North America. Also the largest, it saw an estimated 81 million passengers take off and land on its runways in 2016.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;All flights from Los Angeles to Seoul depart from LAX.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;There are two international airports in the Seoul area, Incheon and Gimpo. From Los Angeles, three airlines fly to Incheon &#38;ndash; Asiana Airlines, Singapore Airlines and Korean Air. International flights apart from Japan, Taiwan and China do not fly to Gimpo.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Incheon airport is situated 48 km from the capital of South Korea. It is arguably the best airport in the world, and has been given that tile by Airports Council International every year since 2005. It is also consistently rated the cleanest airport and its shopping mall has also received widespread accolades.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Travellers can enjoy the golf course, casino, spa, ice skating rink and private sleeping rooms.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Many passengers opt for first class or business class seats on long haul flights simply because it is a good investment for the ease, comfort and convenience. The LA to Seoul journey by air takes 13hours &#38;ndash; is a cramped, uncomfortable economy seat worth the hassle?&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Of course, flying premium class is much more layered than simply better seating. It is also the personal attention from check-in to flight time to baggage retrieval at Seoul. It is the fresh, invigorating meal prepared to your specifications by an acclaimed chef, accompanied by a wine of your choice.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Flying first class and business class is not simply about getting to the destination, it is about starting your holiday before you get to your destination.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h2 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;Why buy tickets with I Fly First Class?&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Just like the right ticket can get your holiday started long before you board a plane, the benefits of choosing the right travel concierge service are much subtler than the speed and convenience I Fly First Class provides.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;We do not consider ourselves just a travel concierge, even though we perform that role so well. No, we take on the role of your personal assistants, completely dedicated to your convenience and well-being.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Tucked in the southern part of Sydney, 5 km from the city centre in the suburb of Mascot is the world&#38;#8217;s oldest commercial and longest continually-operated airport, Kingsford Smith Airport. It is commonly called just Sydney Airport (SYD).&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;This is the only international air travel gateway to and from Sydney for commercial passengers. Australia&#38;#8217;s busiest airport was used by close to 42 million passengers in 2016.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The Sydney to Tokyo route is operated by Australia&#38;#8217;s native carrier, Qantas and by the Japanese Airlines, All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;All Nippon Airways and Qantas fly exclusively to Haneda Airport while Japan Airlines flies only to Narita.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Flights from Sydney land in one of the two international airports serving Tokyo, Haneda and Narita. The airports themselves are both excellent &#38;ndash; modern, clean and extremely orderly. Most passengers choose to land at one or the other because of the relative proximity to Tokyo and other regional destinations.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;HND - Haneda Airport&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;At just 15 km from the centre of the city, Haneda Airport is the most convenient airport option if you have hotel reservations within the city. Once you clear the efficient arrival process at Haneda, a rain commute will take just 15 minutes before you are in the centre of one of the world&#38;#8217;s most modern and exciting cities.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;NRT - Narita Airport&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Despite being regarded as a &#38;lsquo;Tokyo Airport&#38;#8217;, Narita Airport is actually situated outside it, 65 km away in Chiba prefecture. A train ride to Tokyo from Narita takes approximately one hour.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h2 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;Why Fly First Class?&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Whether you land at Haneda or Narita, a direct flight from Sydney to Tokyo is over 9 hours and 35 minutes long. How you look and feel at the end of the arduous journey depends a great deal on whether you travelled by coach, or decided to invest in a first class or business class seat.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The personal attention from the cabin crew, the superior quality of the food and drink, the ample personal space and the ability to get some real shut-eye in an enclosed cabin will do wonders for your state of arrival.&#60;/p&#62;

Located 27 km from &#38;lsquo;The Loop&#38;#8217;, Chicago&#38;#8217;s central business district, handles close to 72 million passengers every year.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;United Airlines and Cathay Pacific both fly from O&#38;#8217;Hare to Hong Kong.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h2 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;Flying into Hong Kong&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;All of Hong Kong&#38;#8217;s international air passenger traffic is handled by the Chek Lap Kok Hong Kong International Airport (HKG). Flights from Chicago&#38;#8217;s O&#38;#8217;hare International Airport arrive here.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Chek Lap Kok is just behind O&#38;#8217;Hare in terms of passenger numbers &#38;ndash; 71 million in 2016 &#38;ndash; making it the world&#38;#8217;s eighth-busiest airport. The airport has been built on an artificial island just off Hong Kong. The HKIA Airport Express links directly to Hong Kong&#38;#8217;s CBD. There are also coaches, taxis and limousines conveniently available.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h2 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;Why Fly First Class?&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;First class and business class seats offer a premium level of comfort and service in the air. For the flight from Chicago to Hong Kong which takes 15 hours and 45 minutes, that extra comfort and care goes a long way.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Of course, the exceptional service does not begin and end on the plane. Both United and Cathay Pacific offer first class and business class passengers access to airport lounges to rest, relax and even work, if need be, before the long haul flight.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;These passengers get:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;li&#62;personalised service and attention on board.&#60;/li&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The food and drink menu is a world apart, with the option of choosing your own chef-created meal before you board.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The seats recline to a horizontal or near-horizontal position to ensure that your work and rest continue in the most comfortable fashion.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Despite the large volume of air traffic, both passenger and cargo that originates at, departs from and transits through Hong Kong, its needs are served by a single international airport. The challenge is taken up by the impressive Hong Kong International Airport (HKG), known locally as Chek Lap Kok.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Sitting on its own island just off the coast of Hong Kong, Chek Lap Kok saw 71 million passengers walk through its halls in 2016, making it the world&#38;#8217;s eighth-busiest airport by passenger numbers.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;It is conveniently connected to the rest of the territory by coaches, taxis and limousines. Flights to Tokyo from HKIA may land at either Haneda or Narita Airports.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h2 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;Flying into Tokyo&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Tokyo is served by two international airports &#38;ndash; Haneda and Narita. The facilities at both are excellent in being modern and clean in the way for which Japan is famous. The most important factor in a traveller&#38;#8217;s choice of airports is often the distance of each from Tokyo:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;HND - Haneda Airport. Haneda Airport is just 15 km from the centre of the city, making it the most convenient stop for anyone short on time. By rail, the commute from Haneda to Tokyo takes just half an hour.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;NRT - Narita Airport. Narita Airport is situated not in Tokyo, but in Chiba prefecture, 65 km away. A train ride to Tokyo from Narita is just over an hour long.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;All Nippon Airways, Cathay Pacific and Japan Airlines fly from Hong Kong to both Haneda and Narita. Ethiopian Airlines, Hong Kong Airlines, Jetstar Japan and Vanilla Air fly only to Narita while Cathay Dragon flies only to Haneda.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Travelling by first class and business class is an experience that simply transcends sitting in an economy seat for any considerable period. For the four-and-a-half-hour journey between Hong Kong and Tokyo, premium class seats go a long way.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The ample legroom, wide armrests and additional personal space accorded by the seating layout gives you the ability to rest, enjoy the entertainment system and even work comfortably if you are travelling for business.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Meals served are not mass-produced by options that you can personalise when you make your booking, which we will also do for you. The cabin crew lavish attention upon you and your needs are personally looked after.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Hong Kong is a tiny island and its only international airport was created on its own artificial island just off the coast. Hong Kong International Airport (HKG), commonly called Chek Lap Kok International Airport handles all international passenger and cargo air traffic to and from the territory.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;A total passenger count of almost 71 million in 2016 made HKG the world&#38;#8217;s eighth-busiest by passenger numbers. The facility is well-linked to the Hong Kong CBD via the Airport Express, taxis, coaches and limousines.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;All flights originating in Hong Kong and terminating in Seoul arrive at South Korea&#38;#8217;s Incheon Airport. The airlines that fly the Hong Kong-Seoul route are:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Seoul has two international airports, Incheon and Gimpo. However, all flights originating in Hong Kong fly exclusively to Incheon, 48 km from Seoul.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Incheon Airport (ICN) is an amazing facility &#38;ndash; it has won the Airport Councils International award for best airport 11 years in row, every year since 2015. The staggering array of entertainment options are one reason &#38;ndash; there is an ice skating rink, golf course, casino and spa for passengers to while the time away.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The airport&#38;#8217;s shopping mall has also won accolades for the diverse range of everyday and luxury items on offer.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The flight from Hong Kong to Seoul is a relatively short one at under four hours. That is just long enough time to look over your plans if you are travelling on business, or to catch some shut-eye to look your best if you are meeting friends and family. The flight experience makes a huge difference either way.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Being able to recline or lay flat to rest, or to get into a comfortable position with ample space for your laptop and documents, is simply not possible in coach. The extra space afforded by seats in first class and business class are the way to go.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The quality of the refreshments served also differ &#38;ndash; first class and business class passengers are offered fine wine and carefully prepared dishes. Amenity kits, often designed by world renowned fashion houses, are yours to keep. The personalised service is par excellence.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Why would you not want to fly first class?&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Chicago, the third most populous city in the United States is served by two international airports &#38;ndash; O&#38;#8217;Hare International Airport (ORD) and Midway International Airport. However, to fly to Tokyo, you will have to depart from Chicago O&#38;#8217;Hare as Midway&#38;#8217;s international routes are only to Mexico.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The world&#38;#8217;s sixth-busiest airport (and the third-busiest in the United States) handles almost 72 million passengers every year. Serving over 200 destinations worldwide, it is conveniently located 27 km from &#38;lsquo;The Loop&#38;#8217;, Chicago&#38;#8217;s central business district.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h2 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;Flying into Tokyo&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Tokyo is served by two international airports &#38;ndash; Haneda and Narita. You can fly to either of these two international airports from Chicago O&#38;#8217;Hare. All Nippon Airways flies to both Haneda and Narita Airports while American Airlines, Japan Airlines, United Airlines fly only to Narita.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The facilities at both airports are equally good; most travellers choose one over the other based on their forward travel plans in Japan because of the difference in the distance of each from Tokyo.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;HND - Haneda Airport&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Haneda Airport is just 15 km from the centre of the city, making it the most convenient stop for anyone short on time. By rail, the commute from Haneda to Tokyo takes just half an hour.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;NRT - Narita Airport&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Narita Airport is situated not in Tokyo, but in Chiba prefecture, 65 km away. A train ride to Tokyo from Narita will take over an hour.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h2 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;Why Fly First Class?&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The thirteen-hour one-way trip between Chicago and Tokyo can be quite an ordeal if you are in an economy class seat. Imagine how you would look and feel when you arrive &#38;ndash; is that how you want to be seen by family and friends, or by bosses, colleagues and subordinates?&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Investing in a first class or business class set lets you enjoy good food and drink, excellent entertainment and incomparable service even before you step on your plane.&#60;/p&#62;

Breeze through the gates with priority boarding. Savour first-rate meals and exceptional wine selections on board. Drift peacefully off to sleep on the lie-flat bed.&#60;/p&#62;

They are ensconced in an aura of extravagant indulgence that people on the outside looking in yearn for.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h2 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;Advantages of Flying First Class&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;If you are searching for a first class or business class flight from New York to Taipei, you have over 200 flights from which to choose.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Out of these, your best options would be Eva Air or China Airlines. Based in Taiwan and China respectively, these two carriers are the only ones that offer direct flights on this route. They both fly from New York&#38;#8217;s JFK to Taipei&#38;#8217;s Taoyuan International Airport.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Although, the companies use the same aircraft, a Boeing 777-300ER, the China Airlines flight&#38;#8217;s cruising speed is faster &#38;ndash; 581 mph compared to Eva&#38;#8217;s 504 mph. However, of the two, the EVA Air flight has a shorter flight time of 15 hours 30 minutes compared to China Airlines&#38;#8217; 15 hours 55 minutes because it takes a shorter route.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The one advantage that China Airlines has is that it provides a first class cabin as well as business and economy while Eva only caters to business and economy passengers. You will still receive a complimentary meal on both flights and enjoy on-board amenities like:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;First class or business class travel can make extended periods inside a cabin much more pleasurable than flying coach. Apart from the extra legroom, wider armrests and seats that actually recline instead of just tilting a few degrees, there is also the better service and superior food and drink on board.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;However, the premium travel experience actually begins even before you board. First class and business class passengers enjoy:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;li&#62;access to exclusive airport lounges.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Flying from New York to Frankfurt, passengers have two direct flight options &#38;ndash; United and &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/airline/lufthansa&#34;&#62;Lufthansa&#60;/a&#62;. United operates the Boeing 777 on their route from New York&#38;#8217;s Newark Airport (EWR) to Frankfurt Airport (FRA) in Germany. The flight takes 7 hours and 45 minutes, flying at 541 mph at an altitude of 8,850 m.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Lufthansa&#38;#8217;s flight originates from New York&#38;#8217;s JFK Airport and terminates at Frankfurt&#38;#8217;s FRA Airport. It is slightly shorter than the United flight at just 7 hours and 30 minutes. Lufthansa operates the Airbus A380 on this route. The aircraft cruises at 11,280 m at a speed of 566 mph.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Both flights travel overnight and dinner is served and refreshments are provided throughout the course of travel. If you use electronic devices, both aircraft have in-seat power but only Lufthansa offers USB power connections.&#60;/p&#62;

How much time it takes to compare dozens of fares from multiple websites? And even after you have done all your research, you may find that there are coupons to be applied that render all your price research meaningless.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;And let&#38;#8217;s not even get into expired coupons&#38;hellip;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Once you travel first class or business class, flying coach simply will no longer hold the thrill it once may have. Airlines are continually expanding the range of services they offer on board and previously unimaginable luxuries like enclosed cabins and lie-flat beds have now become reality.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Pair these comforts with gourmet meals featuring chef-created delicacies and fine wine and you truly have an air travel experience unlike any other. Entertainment options are presented on large personal screens that deliver crisp images and you can enjoy audio with high-quality headphones that place you at the center of the action.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The human element is also crucial to any first class or business class flight. Airlines are always trying to outdo each other in the service arena.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;If you are traveling from Los Angeles to Taipei, you have three direct flight options delivered by two different airlines. China Airlines operates two of them and Taiwan&#38;#8217;s Eva Airways operates one. They all originate from Los Angele&#38;#8217;s LAX and terminate at Taipei&#38;#8217;s Taoyuan International Airport.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Of these three options, China Airlines 7 is the shortest &#38;ndash; just 13 hours and 15 minutes long. The other China Airlines flight is 40 minutes longer. Eva completes the trip in 13 hours 20 minutes.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;If you are looking for a first class seat, you will have to use China Airlines since Eva only offers business and economy seats on this sector.&#60;/p&#62;

The main reason for this is the massive effort that airlines are putting into revamping their premium air services. Travelers are gradually discovering that the vast improvement in amenities and services that these seats offer are well worth the difference in cost.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h2 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;Advantages of Flying First Class&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Among the biggest reasons for this change are factors like gourmet meal options, superior wines to accompany them and much larger personal space &#38;ndash; in some cases even exclusive cabins. Besides these, there is the standard priority check-in, boarding and lounge access.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;If you are traveling from Loss Angeles to Frankfurt, Germany, your best option is a direct flight to cover the nearly 6,000 miles. Only Germany&#38;#8217;s Lufthansa operates direct flights on this route:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Lufthansa flight 451.&#60;/li&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;They both take off from LAX and touch down at Frankfurt&#38;#8217;s FRA Airport. The difference is the aircraft, with the former using a Boring 747 and the latter, an Airbus A380. The Boeing travels faster and higher - 586 mph at 9,750 m compared to the A380&#38;#8217;s 541 mph at 8,850 m &#38;ndash; to cover the distance.&#60;/p&#62;

It is a unique place to be able to lie flat on a real bed instead of reclining just a few inches in an upright seat.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;But both first class and business class travel do not begin after the flight is underway; no, they start even when you are on the ground.

There are lounges for you to while the waiting time away, with free internet access and all the food and drink you want.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Asiana 602 uses a Boeing 777 that flies at 498 mph to cover the distance. Korean 122 uses an A330-300 flying at 558 mph but takes a slightly longer route of 5,190 miles. Breakfast and lunch are served on both flights.&#60;/p&#62;

There are few times in your life where you will be able to enjoy an opportunity to be pampered in every way in such a limited space.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h2 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;Advantages of Flying First Class&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Of course, that is not to say that first class and business class seating is cramped. In fact, quite the opposite is true - premium seats today are longer, wider and more comfortable than ever before. The service and amenities provided by airlines have kept pace also.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Most airlines offer excellent dining options on board, accompanied by superior quality wines. Entertainment programs are constantly upgraded and you are more likely to be able to catch the latest blockbusters which have yet to be released on board a plane than anywhere else.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;&#38;#160;If you plan on flying from Sydney, Australia to Rome, Italy, you will have to layover at least once before you reach your destination. The only option to do this without spending more than an entire day in airports and in the air is to layover at Dubai Airport (DXB) between Sydney Airport and Rome&#38;#8217;s FCO Airport.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Still, the journey will take approximately 21 hours 35 minutes, including a time of 1 hour 35-minute in transit. This option is offered by Emirates Airways.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;li&#62;The first leg is on Emirates 415 for 14 h 10 minutes.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;The second leg is 6 hours 20 minutes long on Emirates 95.&#60;/li&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The other significant difference is how simple we have made the process of obtaining tickets.&#60;/p&#62;

On some sectors, airlines offer completely- enclosed cabins that resemble a hotel room more than a seat on a plane. In our opinion, that is the very definition of the Golden Age of air travel.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;A flight between Chicago and Rome, Italy takes at least 9 hours. Fortunately, there are no less than 7 airlines that offer direct flights on this long route, all of which fly from O&#38;#8217;Hare in Chicago to FCO Airport in Rome. Among these are:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The shortest flight is on American Airlines flight 110, lasting exactly 9 hours.

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Alitalia 629 and United 970 both complete the journey in 9 hours 25 minutes. Alitalia uses the Airbus A330, flying at 542 mph at 10,600 m. United operates a Boeing 777-200 on this route; it flies at 564 mph at the same altitude as Alitalia.&#60;/p&#62;

While air travel itself has become accessible to larger proportions of the population, elite travel has always kept pace with those developments.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h2 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;Advantages of Flying First Class&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;What was first class air service in the years gone by has become a part of regular travel, but only because first class travel of today offers an experience in the air - which actually starts on the ground &#38;ndash; that travelers of yesteryear would never have imagined possible.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;There is not just the incomparable service that equals that of the best hotels, it is also the fact that many amenities you would assume are limited to hotels are made available to you while you cruise far above the surface of the earth.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Gourmet food is virtually a given on any airline in first class. The meals are usually accompanied by wine specially chosen to complement your status. Major airlines nowadays even offer the option of double beds within enclosed cabins that offer comfort comparable to those found in leading hotels.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Two airlines fly direct from New York to Munich - Lufthansa and United.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;It may seem unfortunate that there are no direct flights between Sydney and Frankfurt.

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;As expected, both because of its status as Germany&#38;#8217;s busiest airport and German efficiency, Frankfurt is very well connected to the transport network within the country.

    &#60;h2 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;Advantages of Flying First Class&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;From the moment you step up to the counter at check-in to the exclusive and opulent waiting lounge away from the hectic noise and traffic of the terminal, you will be in a cocoon of personalized attention where staff know your name and attend to your needs enthusiastically and efficiently.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The experience then continues into the air, where cabin staff will attend to your every need and try to anticipate them in advance. Around you, opulent d&#38;eacute;cor and superior food and drink will lull you into feeling like you are at a resort, not inside a plane cabin.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;There are two airlines that will give you this experience if you want to fly direct from Chicago to Frankfurt - Lufthansa and United. Each airline operates two flights on this sector every single day of the week, meaning that you will be spoiled for choice - the perfect option for your schedule awaits.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Both airlines offer first class and business class seating on this route and the journey is between 8 hours 15 minutes and 8 hours 35 minutes long. Lufthansa uses the Boeing 747-8 quad-jet for its flights while United employs the twin-jet Boeing 777-200. Both these planes operate at an altitude of between 10,680 m and 11,280 m and cruise at an airspeed of over 600 mph (965 kph).&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Lie-flat seats are the standard in both first class and business class while all passengers also have access to in-flight Wi-Fi and in-seat and USB power. Besides the regular entertainment options, on-demand video will keep you entertained when you are awake and a noise-cancelling cabin design will help you drift off when it is time to rest.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;United and Lufthansa both take off from Chicago&#38;#8217;s O&#38;#8217;Hare International Airport (ORD) and land at Frankfurt Airport (FRA).&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The city of Frankfurt is served by one international airport, Frankfurt Airport, and all the flights from Chicago land here. Frankfurt Airport is the busiest airport in &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/country/to-germany&#34; title=&#34;First Class flights to Germany&#34;&#62;Germany&#60;/a&#62; by a considerable margin and the fourth busiest airport by passenger traffic numbers in Europe.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The regional rail system connects the airport to Frankfurt Central Station in about 10-12 minutes. Germany&#38;#8217;s long-distance rail network can be accessed via a pedestrian footbridge from the facility; it connects Frankfurt to central rail stations in virtually all major German cities.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The Autobahn is just outside and is accessible via private cars, taxis and buses.&#60;/p&#62;

Gone are the flimsy plastic cutlery and crockery, replaced by actual high-quality ware. Branded amenity kits and lotions, scents and even razors wait in the washrooms.&#60;/p&#62;

The downside is that the entire journey will take 29 hours. However, with an 8 hour 30-minute layover in exciting Bangkok, you might not necessarily mind the extended voyage.

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Qatar Airways is the option that takes the shortest time, 23 hours 25 minutes, including the stopover of 2 hours 5 minutes in Doha. The first leg here takes a long 15 hours 10 minutes and the second, a considerably shorter 6 hours 10 minutes.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h2 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;Advantages of Flying First Class&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Better still, you enjoy the perks of traveling in premium class even before you step aboard a plane &#38;ndash; accelerated check-in, quality lounges and preferential boarding privileges will put a smile on your face as soon as you reach the airport.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;If you intend to travel from New York to &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/city/to-paris-cdg&#34; title=&#34;first class flights to Paris&#34;&#62;Paris&#60;/a&#62; in a first class seat, only the French national carrier, Air France, operates direct flights with that option.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;These are overnight flights that have a scheduled flight time of 7 hours 25 minutes to complete the journey from New York&#38;#39;s JFK International Airport (JFK) to Paris&#38;#39;s Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG). Air France uses A38-800 quad-jets that operate at a cruising altitude of 11,280 m.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;If you opt for business class, there is a lot more variety on offer. Besides the &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/airline/air-france&#34;&#62;Air France flights&#60;/a&#62; that offer both first class and business class, legacy carriers like British Airways, United and American Airlines, and all-business airline, La Compagnie also ply this route.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The La Compagnie flight is the shortest at just 7 hours 15 minutes long on its Boeing 757-200 plane from Newark&#38;#8217;s Liberty International Airport (EWR) to Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG) in Paris. It features angled flat seats. United also flies this route but takes 10 minutes longer and makes up with seats that lie completely flat. It cruises at an altitude of 10,050 m on Boeing 767-400 twin-jets.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;American Airlines and British Airways both depart New York from Newark Airport but while the American 767-300 lands at Charles de Gaulle, the British 757-200 lands at Paris Orly Airport (ORY). Both flights take 7 and a half hours and give business passengers lie-flat seats.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h2 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;Airports in Paris&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;There are three airports in Paris, but only two that are served by flights from New York &#38;ndash; Charles de Gaulle (CDG) and Orly (ORY).&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;CDG in Roissy is situated about 35 km north of Paris city center and the journey by road will take you just over half an hour. Orly, to the south of the city is much closer, just 13 km away so the trip can be completed in less than 15 minutes in normal traffic.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Charles de Gaulle airport is also connected to Paris by a high-speed rail system. On the other hand, you will have to catch the light rail system, Orlyval, to RER, the Paris urban transit rail system.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Lie-flat beds are guaranteed but first class seats offer incomparable width and some flights even have enclosed cabins for complete privacy.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;If you are looking for a direct flight from New York to London, two airlines offer you first class seats on your journey. They are American Airlines and British Airways.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;American Airlines only flies this sector originating from New York&#38;#39;s JFK International Airport (JFK). The British national carrier gives you the option of departing from New York at either JFK or Newark&#38;#39;s Liberty International Airport (EWR). They both land at London Heathrow Airport (LHR).&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;British Airways offers travelers several options on this route but the fastest ones complete the trip departing from either airport in 6 hours and 50 minutes. American Airlines takes a little more time - its flight from JFK is 7 hours long.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;You can enjoy lie-flat seats on all three flights but only American offers in-flight Wi-Fi.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;BA&#38;#39;s EWR flight uses the Boeing 777-200 twin-jet flying at 11,880 m while its flight out of JFK employs the 747-400 cruising at 11,280 m. American Airlines uses the 777-300ER twin-jet with a cruising altitude of 10,680 m on this sector.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;There is slightly more variety from which to choose if you would prefer to travel via business class with Virgin and United entering the picture.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;United and Virgin both fly from EWR to LHR in 7 hours 05 minutes, with the former using a Boeing 767 and the latter, an Airbus A330. You get lie-flat seats on both but United also offers in-flight Wi-Fi which Virgin does not.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Virgin also flies from JFK to LHR using an Airbus A340, completing the journey in 7 hours 10 minutes. Both Virgin planes cruise at 11,280 while the United flies at 10,050 m.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Your only option to fly from New York to London&#38;#39;s Gatwick Airport (LGW) is British Airways. BA completes the journey in exactly 7 hours on a Boring 777 with a cruising altitude of 11,880 m.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h2 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;Airports in London&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The city of London is home to 5 airports. However, if you plan to travel to London from New York in a first class or business class seat, you have two options of arrival airports, London Heathrow (LHR) and London Gatwick (LGW).&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Heathrow is closer to central London, situated just 15 miles west of the city while Gatwick is 30 miles to the south. However, Gatwick is less crowded and is better organized than its bigger cousin which is the world&#38;#39;s busiest international airport.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Both airports are well-connected to the rail and transport system, and most travelers prefer one over the other due to the proximity to their destination in London.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;However, for passengers travelling from Los Angeles, all direct flights will land exclusively at CDG, regardless of the airline.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Charles de Gaulle Airport is the busiest international airport in France.

    &#60;h2 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;Advantages of Flying First Class&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;From the expedited check-in, complimentary luxury lounge access, priority boarding at the airport to the fine wine and gourmet cuisine, exciting entertainment options and beds almost as large as your own on board, first class travel is simply one great discovery after another.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;British Airways and American Airlines both give you the option of flying in style in first class direct from Los Angeles to London. All of American Airlines&#38;#39; flights on this sector are performed using the Boeing 777 while the British Airline employs the Airbus A380.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;While the two airlines offer lie-flat seats, the British Airways A380-800 quad-jet does not have the option of in-flight Wi-Fi while some the American airline&#38;#39;s flights using Boeing 777-300 ERs do.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;They are also similar in that they both take off from Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and touch down at London&#38;#39;s Heathrow Airport (LHR). Travel in first class on these two flights and you will reach your destination in 10 hours 30 minutes.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;If you plan to travel in business class instead, the range of options is considerably wider. Besides the AA and BA flights, United, Air New Zealand and Virgin Atlantic also fly direct from Los Angeles to Heathrow.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;United and Virgin Atlantic both utilize the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, cruising at 10,680 m to complete the leg in ten and a half hours. Air New Zealand flies the same Boeing 777-300Ers as United and spends the same 10 hours 30 minutes in the air. It has a cruising altitude of 10,050 meters.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h2 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;Airports in London&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;There are five airports in the English capital. However, all direct flights from Los Angeles land only at London Heathrow International Airport (LHR), the busiest airport in the world.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Its two runways and four terminals handle 72 million passengers annually, as well as 1.4 million tons of cargo. Planes operated by over 80 airlines fly to and from 180 worldwide destinations.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;As would be expected from an airport of its stature, Heathrow is very well connected to the city of London via road and rail. Heathrow Express trains leave every fifteen minutes for Paddington Station, and arrive at their destination in the same time. It is connected to the South West lines as well as the London Underground systems, too.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h2 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;Advantages of Flying First Class&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The distance between Sydney and Paris is just shy of 17,000 kilometers, or just over 10,500 miles. That is too great a distance to be covered in a direct flight and you will have to take a connecting flight with at least one stop in the journey.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The shortest time that you can complete your trip from Sydney to Paris is with Singapore Airlines which will have you in the French capital in just over 24 hours after you take from Australia.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;It is also the most luxurious; gone are the lie-flat seats, replaced by an enclosed individual suite with a sliding door and blinds for the ultimate privacy. Inside, a 23-inch LCD TV gives you over 1,000 entertainment options as you relax on a chaise lounge 35 inches wide. The seat does not become the bed - that is an entire unit on its own. If you are travelling with a partner, adjacent suites combine for a full-size double bed which will have you skeptical that you are on a plane.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The flight from Sydney to Singapore takes 8 hours 20 minutes, before a 3-hour layover at Singapore&#38;#39;s award-winning Changi Airport. The second leg is 13 hours 20 minutes long.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The best price for a trip from Sydney to Paris comes from Thai Airways. The entire journey takes 29 hours because of the layover in Bangkok that is 7 hours 45 minutes long. However, time zone differences mean you technically land in 21 hours.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Thai Airways uses the Boeing 747 on the first leg of the journey and the Airbus A380 on the second. They both feature lie-flat seats.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h2 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;Airports in Paris&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Paris is home to three international airports but only two are served by flights originating in Sydney&#38;ndash; Charles de Gaulle (CDG) and Orly (ORY).&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;CDG is approximately 35 km north of the city and the journey takes just over half an hour by road. Orly lies to the south of the city and is much closer at just 13 km by road; you can reach Paris in less than 15 minutes at most times.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Charles de Gaulle Airport connects to Paris by a high speed rail system.

    &#60;h2 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;Advantages of Flying First Class&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Be it the superior personal attention, the opulence and luxury of the surrounds and the seats, a taste of gourmet cuisine created under the supervision of world-renowned chefs, or the opportunity to spend a long journey in home-like comfort, first class travel never fails to impress.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;If you are set on traveling first class or business class, you have a choice of two airlines to fly direct from Chicago to Munich. One is the American airline, United Airways, and the other is the German airline, Lufthansa. Both companies fly out of the Windy City&#38;#39;s O&#38;#39;Hare International Airport and both land at the same airport in Munich, Munich International Airport.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;In fact, the flights of both airlines takes the same time, too - 8 hours and 45 minutes. The similarities extend to the inflight experience as well; United and Lufthansa offer first class and business class passengers lie-flat seats and have in-flight W-Fi and in-seat power through USB and standard sockets.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;However, the American airline employs the twin-jet Boeing 777-200 while Lufthansa flies the quad-jet Airbus A340-600 plane. Both aircraft cruise at about 560 mph on this sector but while the Boeing flies at an altitude of 9,450 m, the Airbus jets considerably higher at 11,280 m.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;In-flight service on both aircraft is superb. As they are both overnight flights, a full dinner is served and light refreshments are available throughout the flight.&#60;/p&#62;

For most people, the experience is so unlike any other that they never choose anything but First Class from that point onwards.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h2 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;Advantages of Flying First Class&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Maybe it is the extraordinary personal treatment, where staff on the ground and in the air address you by name and give you their undivided attention in every interaction. Perhaps it could be the opulence and luxury that surround you at every step, again from the moment that you step into the airport, not just on the plane itself.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Either reason or each in parts, you will remember your first class experience for a long time to come.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;No less than eight different airlines fly the direct route from Chicago to Paris without any intermediate connections. However, there is just one airline that offers first class seats on this route and that is United Airlines. They operate a daily overnight flight that leaves Chicago&#38;#39;s O&#38;#8217;Hare International Airport in the evening just before 6 p.m. and lands at Paris Charles de Gaulle International Airport (CDG) midway through the following morning at 9.30 a.m.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;If you would rather fly business class from Chicago to Paris without any connections, there are two options besides United. American Airlines and the French national carrier, Air France also operate direct lights out of O&#38;#39;Hare Airport. Both these flights also land at Paris&#38;#39;s CDG Airport.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Of the three, American Airlines is the fastest at just 7 hours 55 minutes. Air France takes 8 hours 20 minutes and United, 8 hours 35 minutes. In this sense, American makes most sense since it takes off from Chicago just after 7 p.m. and lands in France at 10 a.m.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;You will prefer the American airlines because they both feature lie-flat seats in business class while Air France only has angled flat seats which would be considerably less comfortable on an overnight flight.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;United and American fly the Boeing 767-300 and the Boeing 777-200 respectively on this route while Air France uses the Airbus A330-200. All three aircraft are twin-jets.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The Airbus cruises at the highest altitude of the three, 11,280 m while United&#38;#39;s 767 flies the lowest at 10,050 m. American Airlines&#38;#39; flight skirts the middle at 10,680 m.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;There are three airports in &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/city/to-paris-cdg&#34; title=&#34;Business class airfares to Paris&#34;&#62;Paris&#60;/a&#62;. However, all direct flights from Chicago land at Paris&#38;#8217;s Charles de Gaulle (CDG) Airport.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;It is located about 35 km north of Paris. The trip by road will take you about half an hour in normal traffic. The airport is also connected to Paris by a high speed rail system. However, you will have to first catch the light rail system, Orlyval, from the airport to access the Paris urban transit rail system.&#60;/p&#62;

It is not just because of the opulent d&#38;eacute;cor, the finest food and drink, and the luxury of the amenities; no, flying first class is especially memorable because of the unsurpassed attention to detail in every aspect of the service that you receive.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;It is one of the few remaining experiences that are truly exclusive and held in the highest regard.

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;There is an unmistakable aura around &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/service/first-class-specials&#34;&#62;first class travel&#60;/a&#62;. Something about the opulent, elegant and clearly-marked check-in areas located conveniently near the terminal entrance that leave people wondering. It is in the exclusive lounges at every airport to which signs lead the way around the corner but access and even a glimpse is reserved for the privileged few.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;However, only Hong Kong Airlines offers lie-flat seats here on its Airbus A350s, with China Airlines&#38;#39; A330s only offering extra recline, while EVA&#38;#39;s A321s are fitted with standard recliner seats.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;However, China Airlines and EVA cruise at a speed of 302 mph and complete the journey faster than all the others at a duration of just 1 hour 40 minutes.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Flying first class brings together the best of all worlds in a single experience &#38;ndash; you can revel in the highest standards of entertainment, regale your passion for fine gastronomy and even rest and recuperate in luxury, all facilitated by the very best in personalized attention to be found anywhere in the world&#38;hellip; as you cruise miles above it.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Whether you choose first class or business class, the experience is always one that is quite special. On the rather long journey between Hong Kong and Rome, the quality of the flight experience can make a marked difference to the outcome of your trip, regardless of whether you are traveling for business or for pleasure.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;There is a single airline that offers premium seats on a direct flight between Hong Kong and Rome - the Hong Kong carrier, Cathay Pacific. However, even they only offer business class cabins.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The 13-hour journey is made much more comfortable with the lie-flat seats in the Airbus A350. The plane flies at 453 mph at an altitude of 10,350 m on this route.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The duration of the journey feels a lot shorter with video on demand, and even in-seat and USB power so you always have access to your personal entertainment devices.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h2 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;Airports in Rome&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;There are actually two international airports that serve the city of Rome. Most people are familiar with Leonardo da Vinci Airport which is located in Fiumicino but its less well-known known sibling, Ciampino Airport is also a growing hub. The former is used by major carriers while the latter is the port of choice for budget airways.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Serving close to 42 million passengers annually, Rome&#38;#39;s Leonardo da Vinci International Airport (FCO) is one of the busiest in Europe. It is named after the Italian inventor, artist and scientist, Leonardo da Vinci, who designed a winged flying machine and imagined the world&#38;#39;s first helicopter.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;If you are traveling from HongKong to Rome, the only direct flight on the route is operated by Cathay Pacific and lands here.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The airport is just 22 miles (35 km) from Rome&#38;#39;s famed historic city center, and is well-connected to the region via road and rail networks.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The experience of flying first class does not begin &#38;ndash; nor end &#38;ndash; in the air. It is a multi-faceted adventure that can even begin the moment you decide to leave for the airport and make use of the associated chauffer and/or limousine services. It continues at the airport with expedited and effortless check-in and the luxury of premium lounge access.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Of course, the onboard experience is peerless, but that is not the end; some airlines even offer concierge services at your destination airport to ensure that the journey from there is every bit as comfortable as the experience that preceded it.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;There are only two direct flights between Hong Kong and Frankfurt, one operated by the HongKong carrier, Cathay Pacific and the other by Germany&#38;#39;s national airline, Lufthansa.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;They both take off from Hong Kong Airport (HKG) and fly to Frankfurt Airport (FRA). The Asian airway, flying at 472 mph, takes 12 hours 15 minutes to complete the trip while the German airline is marginally faster at 12 hours 5 minutes as it flies at 479 mph.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;While they both feature lie-flat seats and of almost identical duration, Lufthansa&#38;#39;s offering of Wi-Fi on board its Airbus A380 quad-jets is not available on Cathay&#38;#39;s Boeing 777-300ER twin-jet aircraft.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Just the term &#38;lsquo;First Class&#38;#8217; conjures up images of exquisite elegance, and perhaps even more so when it is associated with air travel. A first class ticket on a journey by air is a gateway into a world of pleasure and convenience that sometimes cannot even imagined by those who have not had the opportunity to experience it.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Travelers in first class do not simply go on a journey from departure to destination; they enjoy an experience that regales the senses and creates lifelong memories. The very best in fine dining, entertainment and comfort are complemented by incomparable personalized service.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The Hong Kong to Munich route is not one where travelers looking for a direct flight have many airline options. If you want to travel by first class, there are no options at all. However, the German carrier, Lufthansa, operates nonstop flights between the two cities with business class seats.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Lufthansa also makes up by offering daily flights. These overnight journeys are of 12 hours 5 minutes&#38;#8217; duration, leaving HongKong Airport (KKG) late at night and arriving at Munich&#38;#39;s &#38;#39;s Franz Josef Strauss Airport early the next morning.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;They use an Airbus A350-900 (twin-jet) that flies at 548 mph and cruises at an altitude of 11,580 m. The seats lie flat in business class and, besides the usual creature comforts, passengers also have the added convenience of on-board Wi-Fi.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h2 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;Airports in Munich&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;There is only one international airport in the vicinity of the city of Munich &#38;ndash; the Franz Josef Strauss Airport (MUC).&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;It is a relatively short 18 miles (29 kilometers) from the city itself, and the wide highways and frequent trains make connecting to the city, the region and even the rest of the country a simple and efficient affair. A trip by car from the airport to Munich takes about half an hour.&#60;/p&#62;

No, the moment you decide to travel in first class, you give yourself a passport, pardon the pun, to an unparalleled world of luxury and exquisite adventures in the air and even on the ground.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;A first class ticket will grant you access to dedicated and expedited check-in lanes, premium lounges in airports across the world, and priority boarding and seating as a precursor to the experience even before the plane lifts off.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;It is the busiest air hub in France and one of the busiest in the world.

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;In terms of comfort and amenities, Aer Lingus offers the most complete package with lie-flat seats and inflight Wi-Fi.

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;First class travel is one of the few modern experiences that remains outside the reach of the average individual. It is one of the last bastions of exclusivity that is revered for the aura of style and grandeur it commands.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The secret behind the allure of first class travel is that airlines have always felt a need to maintain and elevate their first class standards to keep pace with developments and preserve its distinctive character. Comfort, good food and wine are an essential part of traveling in premium class seats, but double beds, chef-prepared buffets and even showers complete the picture perfectly.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The New York to Barcelona route is one of those that offers business class seats but not first class. This is the case if you want a direct flight; several airways allow you to travel in first class if you are willing to stop over in a third city.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Three airlines fly nonstop and all are based in the U.S. - United, American and Delta. All three offer almost identical basics - an overnight flight, inflight Wi-Fi, lie-flat seats, and in-seat and USB power.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;American Airlines has the fastest option - you land after a flight that has a duration of just 7 hours and 30 minutes. Delta is the slowest, arriving in Barcelona 8 hours 6 minutes after take-off.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The difference is mainly due to the fact that United flies out of Newark Airport (EWR) while Delta and American operate out of JFK Airport (JFK). All three land at Barcelona&#38;#8217;s El Prat Airport (BCN).&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h2 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;Airports in Barcelona&#60;/h2&#62;

There are two regional airports, Reus and Girona, about 60 miles each from Barcelona. El-Prat is just 7.5 miles (12 kilometers) southwest of the city.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;It is Europe&#38;#8217;s seventh-busiest airport.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Such unusual experiences are simply the more amazing adventures in which you can indulge while traveling on a first class ticket. While they may not available on all flights, you are always assured of the best food and wine, delightful personal attention and a host of entertainment and personal comfort options.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Although New York and Dubai are both major tourist hubs, certain restrictions mean that only Emirates Airways, the national carrier of the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.) where Dubai is located, flies direct from New York to that city.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Taking off from New York&#38;#8217;s JFK Airport (JFK) and arriving at Dubai International Airport (DXB), the flight duration is between 12 hours 30 minutes and 12 hours 50 minutes. Emirates operates a specially-fitted Airbus A380 on this sector, which allows it to provide individual suites to each first class passenger.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The massive complex is built over 2,900 hectares (7,200 acres) of land, making it the largest airline hub in the Middle East. Its Terminal 3 is the world&#38;#39;s largest airport terminal and also the largest building in the world by floor space.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The safety and security standards in place are extraordinary - all foreign passengers arriving at DXB (and every airport in the U.A.E.) are subject to retinal scans. A state-of-the-art drugs detection system can be triggered by as little as 0.001 grams of illegal drugs on a person.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;That the pleasure of an experience of first class travel is exquisite is one of the few things on which almost everyone agrees.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Some may appreciate the gourmet food above other aspects, the exceptional comfort of lie-flat beds on long haul flights may attract others, while still others might feel that the personal attention is its best feature. Whichever your preference, airlines are constantly striving to improve the first class experience they give their passengers with innovative additions.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Flying first class allows you to arrive at your destination better rested with more energy and even in a better mood. Why would you trade that for anything else?&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The New York to Stockholm direct route is only offered by a single carrier - Scandinavian Airlines Systems, or SAS. These are operated daily aboard the Airbus A330-300 twin jet plane.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Passengers looking to fly the route in a premium seat will have to settle with business class. However, SAS does offer lie-fat seats, inflight Wi-Fi, in-seat and USB power and video on demand even in their business cabin.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Flying at 529 mph and cruising at 11,280 feet, the journey has a duration of 7 hours 55 minutes.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;First class travel is synonymous with opulence and luxury. However, first class travelers are usually drawn more to the convenience that the experience offers than anything else.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The first class experience is marked by unsurpassed attention to detail at every step. Exclusive check-in counters make the process a breeze. You can then make your way to a plush executive lounge to wait for your flight. Some airports even offer special counters which expedite immigration checks. Priority boarding completes the calm, effortless pre-flight stage.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;On board, the incomparably comfortable seating is complemented by a wide range of entertainment options and the excellent, personalized service. Many airways give you the option of choosing your own menu, prepared by acclaimed chefs.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The New York to Madrid, Spain direct route is a popular one and there are several flights available daily, operated by numerous airways. However, they all only offer business class cabins, not first class.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The flight of the shortest duration is Iberia&#38;#39;s 7 hour 5-minute journey aboard its Airbus A340. Its lie-flat seats are good while inflight Wi-Fi, in-seat &#38;amp; USB power and video on demand sweeten the deal.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;United also gives passengers the same amenities but its Boeing 767 flight is slightly longer at 7 hours 15 minutes. American Airlines offers the same flight time on the same aircraft type but does not offer Wi-Fi on board.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;All these flights take off from JFK Airport and land at Madrid&#38;#8217;s Adolfo Suarez Madrid-Barajas Airport (MAD).&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The Spanish capital of Madrid is home to one civilian international airport, the Adolfo Suarez Madrid-Barajas Airport (MAD). Just 8 miles (13 km) from Madrid&#38;#39;s historic city center and 6 miles (9 km) from its financial district, it is the perfect spot from which to start your Spanish holiday.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The Madrid Metro line links the airport to the financial district, and also connects to the Spanish railway network.

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;One thing to note is that if you are transferring from an international to domestic flight at Copenhagen Airport, you need approximately 40 minutes to travel between terminals.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Flying first class is the epitome of luxury travel. Few experiences can offer a comparable level of sophistication and extravagance. It does not matter by which facet you judge its standards &#38;ndash; the cuisine, entertainment, amenities, comfort and service are all a cut above the rest.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;However, even the pre-flight experience for first class and business class travelers is superior to that of the average traveler&#38;#8217;s. From smooth, hassle-free check-in and exclusive waiting lounges at the airport to priority boarding, the preferential treatment begins even before you leave the ground.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;And when you do board, the excellent, personalized service continues as you are presented with a vast variety of entertainment and dining options amidst opulent settings.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;There is no shortage of direct flights between New York City and Moscow; the Russian national airway, Aeroflot, operates three flights on this route every day of the week.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;All Aeroflot&#38;#39;s direct flights to Moscow originate from New York City&#38;#39;s JFK Airport (JFK) and terminate at Moscow&#38;#39;s Sheremetyevo International Airport (SVO). The duration of the flights is between 9 hours 5 minutes and 9 hours 20 minutes.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The late evening flight is operated using a Boeing 777 and has lie-flat seats while the other two use Airbus A330s that only have angled flat seats. All the flights have onboard Wi-Fi and in-seat power.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h2 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;Airports in Moscow&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;There are two airports serving the Russian capital - Sheremetyevo International Airport (SVO) and Moscow Domodedovo Airport (DME). However, direct flights from New York all land at SVO.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;SVO is situated 18 miles (29 km) northwest of the city. Handling 32 million passengers annually, it is the busiest airport in the Russian Federation.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;A rail network connects the airport to downtown Moscow. If you have travelled in premium class to Moscow by air, you can continue the experience with business class coaches on the Aeroexpress trains. The journey takes about 35 minutes.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;A new highway network lets you travel between the city and the airport in about 10 minutes.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The flight is of approximately 15 hours&#38;#8217; duration, completed on Boeing 777-300 twin-jets that fly at 585 mph and cruise at 8,850 m.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;In a world where standards of quality seem to continually drop, one experience still stands hands and shoulders above the rest &#38;ndash; first class air travel.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Regardless of which element of a travel experience you value above others &#38;ndash; the service, the cuisine, the entertainment or the comfort &#38;ndash; first class travel checks all the boxes. It is sometimes hard to believe that it is possible to deliver to such high standards in each one of those areas in a plane cabin high above the Earth.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Even the pre-flight process of check-in is streamlined with exclusive counters, and executive lounges are available for your pleasure while you wait to board.&#60;/p&#62;

Emirates has both first class and business class cabins while Delta only has business class.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Emirates offers the ultimate luxury of individual suites if you choose to travel with them in first class. However, in business class they only have angled flat seats and, in this respect, Delta&#38;#39;s lie-flat business class seats have the advantage.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The other point in Delta&#38;#39;s favor is the provision of inflight Wi-Fi on its Boeing 767s which Emirates&#38;#8217; Boeing 777s do not offer, even in first class.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;However, Emirates completes the journey in 9 hours 10 minutes flying from Newark Airport (EWR) whereas the duration of the Delta flight flying from JFK Airport is considerably longer at 9 hours 53 minutes.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;First class air travel is the consummate example of how you do not have to abandon the luxury to which you are accustomed simply because you leave home.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;If you love your food and drink, there is gourmet food and fine wine selections that rival what you may find in a leading restaurant. If rest and recuperation is the priority, lie-flat beds bring the feeling of your bedroom to your plane cabin. For those looking to be entertained, large personal flat screens and high-quality headphones deliver superior images and sound.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;There are several daily flights from New York to Milan, Italy operated by a number of carriers. However, only the Italian carrier, Alitalia, and Emirates Airways offer first class seating here.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Emirates is the more luxurious option with its Airbus A380 individual suites. Alitalia offers lie-flat seats in the first class cabin aboard its A330. These two carriers are joined by United and American Airlines in the business class offering with lie-flat seats. Of these, only American Airlines does not have inflight Wi-Fi.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Apart from United Airlines which flies from Newark Airport (EWR), all direct flights to Milan take off from New York&#38;#8217;s JFK Airport (JFK). However, they all land at Milan&#38;#8217;s Milan Malpensa Airport (MXP).&#60;/p&#62;

All direct flights from New York land at the latter.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Located 29 miles (41 km) from the city, it is the larger of the two and handles about 20 million passengers a year.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Local express trains run every half hour to two terminal stations while two daily high-speed services connect it to the larger region.

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;If you are accustomed to the finer things in life, you do not have to go without simply because you are traveling. Flying first class ensures that the luxuries that you indulge in on the ground are just as accessible in the air.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;It is not just the gourmet food, fine wine and lie-flat beds that make the difference, it is also the excellent service that you receive even before you board your flight. Accelerated check-in, a larger baggage allowance and access to premium lounges ensure that you have a taste of first class on the ground.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;There are no direct flights between New York and Cape Town in South Africa. The best option is a 1-stop route; two carriers - British Airways and Emirates - offer it with first class cabins while several other carriers have business class cabins.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The flight of the shortest overall duration is offered by British Airways and completes the journey in 20 hours 5 minutes, including a 1 hour 45-minute layover at Heathrow Airport in London. It has lie-flat seats in both first class and business class on its Boeing 747s.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Emirates offers the more luxurious first class option with individual suites. Their business class has lie-flat seats. It takes 23 hours 10 minutes to arrive in Cape Town after a 1-hour layover in Dubai.&#38;#160; The first leg is on the Airbus A380, and the second on a Boeing 777.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Most of us agree that flying can be one of the most stressful experiences to have &#38;ndash; there are schedules to keep, unanticipated delays after you meet those schedules, baggage limitations and confusing airport layouts to deal with. Forget all that hassle by flying first class instead.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;While flying first class or business class won&#38;#8217;t miraculously reverse delays or make airports more navigable, it does have a magic that can help. You can spend your time in luxurious lounges while you wait, be personally escorted where you wish, and enjoy preferential treatment even before you board.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;On board, excellent cuisine, entertainment options, opulent surrounds and flat beds complete the picture.&#60;/p&#62;

United 962 leaves Newark Airport (EWR) at 5:50 p.m. every evening and completes the journey in a duration of 8 hours, touching down in Germany at Berlin&#38;#39;s Tegel Airport (TXL) at 7:50 a.m.&#60;/p&#62;

Their Boeing 767-300 twin jet flies at 651 mph at an altitude of 10,680 m.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The airport is renowned for its hexagonal terminal design which ingeniously reduces the distance from aircraft to terminal exit to as little as 98 feet (30 meters). It serves about 22 million passengers annually.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;There are rail connections directly from the airport to regional and long-distance destinations. The city center is just 25 minutes away by road.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;If you have ever felt stressed or encumbered by guidelines and bureaucracy when traveling, perhaps flying first class is the answer. Gone are the long lines at check-in, replaced by dedicated counters. Say goodbye to restrictive baggage limits and enjoy generous allowances.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;When you board, a word of luxury and privilege awaits &#38;ndash; fine wine and food, large personal screens and high-quality headphones, and excellent service that brings out the best of the experience.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Especially on a long-haul flight, these elements come together to create a world where lifelong memories are made.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;New York and Sydney, Australia are separated by the breadth of both the continent of North America and the Pacific Ocean, a whopping 9929-mile journey. No airway flies direct between these two fun cities but a number of them offer single-stop flights.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The two quickest options are an American Airlines-Qantas combination which touches down in Sydney within 22 hours and a wholly American Airlines choice which takes 10 minutes longer.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The first has a layover in Dallas Fort Worth Airport (DFW) for 1 hour 15 minutes after a journey on a United A321 with standard recliner seats. The Qantas leg is performed on an Airbus A380 with lie flat seats.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The 100% United Airlines option uses an Airbus A321 from JFK to LAX, where there is a 40-minute layover. The second leg is on a Boeing 777.&#38;#160; Both aircraft have lie-flat seats and inflight Wi-Fi.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Sydney, Australia is served by a single international civilian airport &#38;ndash; Kingsford-Smith Airport (SYD). Located just 5 miles (8 km) from the heart of the city, it is Australia&#38;#8217;s largest, handling 42 million passenger movements a year.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;An underground rail line connects the airport to the city. However, it is not used solely for airport transfers but forms part of the regular state rail network. A bus service connects the facility to the world-famous Bondi Beach. The excellent road network allows passengers to travel quickly from the airport to the city and also to regional destinations.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Just the phrase &#38;lsquo;&#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/service/first-class-specials&#34;&#62;first class travel&#60;/a&#62;&#38;#8217; inspires visions of opulent luxury, fine cuisine and finer wines at 30,000 feet, and personalized service beyond compare. These aren&#38;#8217;t just visions, though; airlines are continually upgrading and improving their first class and business class offerings to maintain this aura of exquisite privilege.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;On a long-haul flight like the one between Los Angeles and Sydney, such comfort and pleasure can make a real difference for a great start to a vacation or business trip.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;There are four different airlines that fly direct between Los Angeles and Sydney - United, Qantas, Virgin Australia and Delta. While they all depart from Los Angeles Airport (LAX) and land at Sydney Airport (SYD), only the Australian national carrier gives you the option of first class seats.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;All of these flights are virtually identical in duration, ranging from 13 hours 55 minutes to 14 hours 5 minutes. However, because they all fly westwards across the international dateline, it is an interesting play of time that you will touch down in Sydney on a date 2 days after you leave Los Angeles.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Qantas Airways uses the Airbus A380, which cruises at an altitude of 9,750 m and at a speed of 557 mph on this sector. Virgin and Delta use Boeing 777-300ER which flies at an altitude of 9,150 m at 571 mph. United&#38;#8217;s Boeing 787-9 flies the highest &#38;ndash; 10,350 m - at a speed of 559mph.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h2 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;Airports in Sydney&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Sunny Sydney is home to a single international airport, the Kingsford-Smith Airport (SYD). It is located just 5 miles (8 km) from the city center, closer than most other airports of its size in other countries.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Over 42 million passengers walked through its gates last year. To accommodate this huge volume of passenger traffic, the complex is well-connected to the city and region by a good road and rail network. There are no dedicated trains to the airport; rather, it is just another stop on the normal lines.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Sometimes it is hard to believe the level of comfort that you can enjoy while traveling miles above the ground, the trappings of home and the delight of first-rate food and wine at your beck and call. But that is the first class experience.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;When you are looking to fly the immense distance between the cities of Los Angeles and &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/city/to-copenhagen-cph&#34; title=&#34;first class tickets to Copenhagen&#34;&#62;Copenhagen&#60;/a&#62;, being ensconced in a world of luxury and comfort can mean the difference between the perfect start to your getaway and a jet-lagged ordeal.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Because of the large distance involved, no airway operates direct flights from Los Angeles to Copenhagen that offer either first class or &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/service/one-way-business-class-tickets&#34;&#62;business class seats&#60;/a&#62;.

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The main variable you have to consider is the layover airport and the period of that layover.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The shortest of these is the collaboration between Lufthansa and United Airlines that will have you stepping off in Copenhagen 13 hours 20 minutes after you depart LAX. It has the shortest layover of exactly one hour at Germany&#38;#39;s Frankfurt Airport (FRA).&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Traveling, especially on long-distance flights like those between New York and Beijing, can be a stressful affair.

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Two airlines offer non-stop flights on the New York to Beijing route &#38;ndash; United and Air China.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;However, only Air China offers first class cabins on this sector. It operates from JFK Airport in the United States and lands at Beijing Capital International Airport (PEK) in the Chinese capital. On the other hand, United Airlines offers business class seats on its &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/city/to-beijing-pek&#34;&#62;flights to Beijing&#60;/a&#62; which originate at Newark Airport (EWR) and land at PEK.&#60;/p&#62;

The Air China flight cruises at 573 mph at an altitude of 9,450 m while United uses an airway at an altitude of 8,850 m and flies at 540 mph.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Both airlines offer lie-flat seats but United&#38;#39;s cabins have the added advantage on in-flight Wi-Fi for your convenience.&#60;/p&#62;

The first is the Beijing Capital International Airport (PEK) while Beijing Nanyuan Airport (NAY) performs the role of the city&#38;#8217;s secondary airport. A new major international airport, the Beijing Daxing International Airport is expected to be completed and in operation by late 2018.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Beijing Capital International Airport is one of the largest and busiest airports in the world. Inter-terminal transport across the vast complex is via automated people movers and regular buses.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The Beijing Subway system has a dedicated Airport Express Line that connects two of the three terminals directly to the city. A journey from the city to the airport takes approximately 20 minutes.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;There are also direct feeder bus services from several points within the city of Beijing to the airport, as well as to major neighboring cities from the airport.

They are supplemented by preferential check-in, lounge and boarding facilities even before you step on your plane.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;First class and &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/service/one-way-business-class-tickets&#34;&#62;business class seats&#60;/a&#62; are especially welcome on long-haul flights like the one from Los Angeles to Amsterdam. Despite the fact that Amsterdam is a major European tourist destination, there are no direct flights to that city from Los Angeles.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Most major airlines that serve the sector have at least one option to complete the trip with just a single stopover. They all depart from Los Angeles Airport (LAX) and terminate at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport (AMS).&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The flight times vary from under 13 hours to almost 16 hours.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;British Airways is the fastest choice at 12 hours 50 minutes, which consists of an initial leg from LAX to London Heathrow Airport (LHR) that takes 10 hours 20 minutes followed by a 1 hour 10-minute layover. The final leg takes just 1 hour 20 minutes.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Air France flies from LAX to Paris&#38;#39;s Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG), a trip that takes 10 h 40 minutes. After a 1 hour 35-minute layover, it begins the 1 hour 20 min leg to AMS to complete the journey in 13 hours 35 minutes.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The United Airlines option is fractionally longer at 13 hours 48 minutes. It flies for 4 hours 6 minutes from LAX to Chicago for a 1 hour 27-minute layover, before flying to AMS in 8 hours 15 minutes.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h2 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;Airports in Amsterdam&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (AMS) lies to the southwest of the Dutch city and is the only civilian airport that serves its residents. Not only is it the busiest airport in the country, it is also the fifth largest in all of Europe.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The 9 miles (14.5 km) distance from the city center is easily and quickly covered by an efficient road and rail network. The journey by road takes approximately half an hour and just 20 minutes by train. The latter option is especially convenient with a station right under the airport.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;For most people, flying first class will forever be a dream out of reach. If you are one of the fortunate few who is privy to this world of luxury and opulence, you know that it is one of the most exquisite experiences that anyone can have.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Airlines lay out the red carpet for first class and business class passengers even before they board. Some offer chauffeur limousine services for pick-up, while priority check-in and boarding, and access to opulent lounges are standard fare.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;This excellent treatment on the ground is just a preview of the onboard luxury that awaits. Lose yourself in the fine wine and chef-prepared food, and drift off to sleep in an enclosed suite while being entertained on a large personal screen connected to noise-canceling earphones.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;No airline flies direct from Los Angeles to Milan but there are ample options available with a single layover that are extremely convenient.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Of these, SwissAir&#38;#39;s offering is the most luxurious. While other airlines do have lie-flat seats, SwissAir gives first class passengers an enclosed suite for the first part of the journey from LAX to Zurich Airport (ZRH). This leg takes 10 hours 55 minutes, and after a 2 hour 5-minute layover, the second leg of just 50 minutes begins.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Lufthansa offers the quickest option of just 13 hours 25 minutes overall even though the total flight time is longer than SwissAir&#38;#39;s offering. This is because there is just a 1 hour 20-minute layover at Frankfurt between the 10 hour 55-minute leg from LAX and the 1 hour 10-minute leg to Milan (MXP).&#60;/p&#62;

The first is Milan Malpensa Airport (MXP) and the second, Linate International Airport (LIN). International flights connecting from Los Angeles are split roughly equally between the two.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;MXP is the second-busiest airport in the country after Rome. It is situated 30 miles (49 km) northwest of Milan. Located 29 miles (41 km) from the city, LIN is the larger of the two. However, they both handle about 20 million passengers a year.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Regular express trains run every half hour to their terminal stations while two daily high-speed services connect them to the larger region. The airports are also accessible by highways and motorways.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;When you can have good caviar, gourmet cheese, fine wine and chef-created gastronomic masterpieces at 30,000 feet, is there really a need to come back down to earth?&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Flying first class is a transcendental experience, one against which normal flights simply pale in comparison. The best airline companies are in constant competition to innovate the most comprehensive first class experience, which means that passengers are, and always will be, enjoying ever better trips in the future.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;An essential part of the premium flight experience actually begins on the ground. Expedited check-in, priority boarding, exclusive lounge access and preferential treatment begin at the airport. Some airlines even offer complimentary chauffeur services to the airport for first class and business class passengers.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Flying first class from Los Angeles to Beijing can be a tiresome affair &#38;ndash; a direct flight takes close to 13 hours and those with stopovers can take considerably longer. The only airline that currently offers first class cabins on this route is Air China.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The Chinese carrier employs Boeing 777-300 ERs on this sector, and both first class and business class cabins have lie-flat seats. Flying at a speed of 578 mph, it cruises at an altitude of 9,150 m.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The Chinese capital of Beijing is served by two commercial international airports, the Beijing Capital International Airport (PEK), which is the main airport and the Beijing Nanyuan Airport (NAY), which performs the role of a secondary airport.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;A new major international airport is currently under construction and is expected to be completed by late 2018. It will be named the Beijing Daxing International Airport.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;PEK is the country&#38;#8217;s biggest airport and also one of the world&#38;#8217;s busiest.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The local rail network connects directly to the airport via two lines, reducing a journey from the city center to the complex to just 20 minutes. Bus services are also available, while three toll roads give access to private cars and taxis.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;There are not many experiences like that of flying first class because there are few other choices that remain so firmly in the realm of the elite. It is characterized by extraordinary service and superior attention to detail at every stage.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;From enclosed cabins in the air to gourmet food you can personally select to be prepared by a specific chef before you fly, first class air travel delivers incomparable comfort and pleasure.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Only Singapore Airlines and British Airways give travelers the option of first class seats when flying from Sydney &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/city/to-singapore-sin&#34; title=&#34;first class airfares to Singapore&#34;&#62;to Singapore&#60;/a&#62;. On the other hand, passengers who wish to travel by business class can add the Australian carrier, Qantas, and even budget airline, Scoot, to their list of options.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Singapore Airlines and British Airways first class cabins offer lie-flat seats, as does Qantas business class. Scoot, however, only offers extra reclining seats in &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/service/one-way-business-class-tickets&#34;&#62;business class&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The Singaporean carrier is considered one of the best airlines in the world, and the service on board is impeccable even if you travel coach. In first class, it is another world altogether. Coupled with a very new fleet, it is arguably the best option on this route.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Singapore Airlines, Qantas and Scoot all fly from Sydney to Singapore every day but Singapore Airlines plies the sector up to four times on certain days of the week. The total flight time varies between 8 hours and 8 hours 20 minutes for all the four operators.&#60;/p&#62;

Every conceivable amenity is available within its massive grounds, spread over three terminals.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The Singaporean transport system is one of the best in the world and very affordable, too. The MRT subway system has a dedicated airport line while a reliable bus network will take you to the city within 40 minutes.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The world&#38;#8217;s best car rental companies have offices in Changi Airport and offer a variety of vehicle options. However, automobile prices are very high in the country and this carries over to rental rates. Most travelers find that the public transport system is suitable for their needs.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;There are no non-stop flights between the cities of Sydney and Phuket in either first or business class.

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The option with the shortest flight time is offered by Singapore Airlines and its subsidiary, SilkAir. It involves a flight time of just 11 hours 5 minutes, including a brief stop of 55 minutes at Singapore&#38;#39;s Changi Airport.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The first leg is particularly luxurious, with each first class passenger receiving an individual suite on the SIA Airbus A380. The second, 11 hour 20-minute leg offers only business class and has standard recliner seats.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Thai Airways has a similar offering - &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/service/first-class-specials&#34;&#62;first class&#60;/a&#62; with lie-flat seats on the 9 hour 25-minute journey &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/city/to-bangkok-bkk&#34;&#62;to Bangkok&#60;/a&#62;, and an angled seat in business class to Phuket.

While it offers lie-flat seats on the first leg, you will have to contend with a standard recliner seat on the journey from the Malaysian capital to Phuket.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;It is Thailand&#38;#39;s third-busiest airport and sees more than 15 million passenger movements every year.

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;If you want to flying to Vietnam from Sydney, you will first have to decide which of the major cities in this Southeast Asian country will be your destination. &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/city/to-ho-chi-minh-city-sgn&#34; title=&#34;first class airfares to Ho Chi Minh City&#34;&#62;Ho Chi Minh City&#60;/a&#62;, the Vietnamese capital located in the south, and the city of Hanoi in the north are the two most popular choices for Aussie travelers.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;There are no direct flights from Sydney to either Ho Chi Minh or Hanoi in first class. Vietnam Airlines offers business class seats, though, and the journey time is 8 hours 15 minutes to the capital and 9 hours 35 minutes to Hanoi. Business class passengers on Vietnam Airlines enjoy the space and comfort of lie-flat seats on board the Boeing 787s used on both routes.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h2 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;Airports in Vietnam&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;There are 11 civilian airports in Vietnam currently capable of handling international flights and they are spread across the country.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Ho Chi Minh City is served by Tan Son Nhat International Airport (SGN), Vietnam&#38;#8217;s busiest airport. Nearly 33 million passengers arrived or departed from here in 2016. Because there is urban sprawl around the airport, it has limited expansion potential and will be replaced by a new airport in the near future.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Noi Bai International Airport (HAN) in &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/city/to-hanoi-han&#34;&#62;Hanoi&#60;/a&#62; is Vietnam&#38;#39;s second-largest airport, and is located 21 miles (35 km) northeast of the city center. It handled close to 21 million passengers in 2016. Noi Ban received a major overhaul in 2015, which led to it receiving the &#38;lsquo;World&#38;#39;s Most Improved Airport&#38;#8217; award from Skytrax in 2016.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;No other way of traveling vast distances combines speed, comfort and style the way that &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/service/first-class-specials&#34;&#62;first class&#60;/a&#62; and business class travel do. Passengers have access to superior food, wine and entertainment options, which makes for an unforgettable experience in the air.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;There are direct flights between Sydney and Fiji but none that offer first class seats - you will have to settle for business class. There are two Fijian destinations to which you can fly - Nadi and Suva.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Fiji Airways and Virgin Australia fly direct to Nadi. The Fijian airline completes the journey in a time of 3 hours 55 minutes in an Airbus A330 while Virgin takes 4 hours 15 minutes in a Boeing 737. The Boeing has standard recliner seats while the Airbus has angled flat seats. In the air, Virgin flies at 518 mph at an altitude of 10,680 m while Fiji Airways does so at 540 mph at 11,280 m.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;If you intend to fly directly to Suva, your only option is Fiji Airways. The journey takes 4 hours 20 minutes on board their Boeing 737 with standard recliner seats in business class.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h2 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;Airports in Fiji&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;It is amazing that in a country as small as Fiji, there are 16 airports and airfields that regularly receive commercial airline flights. Of these, only Nadi International Airport (NAN) on the western side of Fiji&#38;#39;s main island, and Nausori International Airport (SUV) on its eastern side, cater to international flights. The other 14 provide air links from regional areas to Nadi, Suva or both.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Nadi Airport handles approximately 97% of the international passenger traffic while Nausori caters to the rest. In 2014, just under 2 million passengers landed at or departed from Nadi.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;If you are traveling a long-distance route like that between Sydney and Hawaii, first class and business class seats can make a significant difference. The duration of the journey depends on your specific destination in Hawaii.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;There are four main international airports in the U.S. state of Hawaii - Daniel K. Inouye International Airport (HNL) in Honolulu, Oahu, Kahului Airport (OGG) on Maui Island, Kona International Airport (KOA) on Hawaii Island, and Lihue Airport (LIH) on Kauai Island.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Of these, there are only direct flights from Sydney to Honolulu Airport (HNL). This is a 9 hours 55-minute flight on a Hawaiian Airlines Airbus A330. The plane flies at 535 mph at an altitude of 12,510 m. It is the quickest way to reach Hawaii from Sydney.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The only Hawaiian destination that offers first class cabins all the way is Kailua, and the flights are a collaboration between Korean Air and Hawaiian Airlines. However, the journey takes a time of over 26 hours, making layovers in Seoul and Honolulu.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;On the other hand, Hawaiian Airlines will complete the trip in 12 hours 36 minutes, including the layover time of 1 hour 52 minutes in Honolulu, if you are willing to forego first class on the final leg.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h2 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;Airports in Hawaii&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;In 2015, 14 airports in the U.S. state of Hawaii had passengers boarding domestic and international commercial flights. Of these, the Daniel K. Inouye International Airport (HNL) in Honolulu on Oahu Island handled approximately 9.5 million passengers, almost double all the others put together.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The second major airport is Kahului Airport (OGG) on Maui Island, which saw just over 3 million passengers. It is followed by Kona International Airport (KOA) in Kailua-Kona on Hawaii Island (aka Big Island), and Lihue Airport (LIH) in Lihue on Kauai Island. They handled 1.4 million and 1.3 million passengers respectively.&#60;/p&#62;

First class travel is the epitome of luxury in the air with its excellent service, the best gourmet food and vintage wines yours to enjoy to your heart’s content.</summary><body>&#60;h2 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;Advantages of Flying First Class&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;There are few direct flights from Sydney to Asian destinations that have first class cabins, and Bali does not buck the trend. However, three airlines offer &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/service/one-way-business-class-tickets&#34;&#62;business class seating&#60;/a&#62; for you to begin your Bali getaway - Virgin Australia, Garuda Indonesia and Qantas.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Qantas offers the quickest option at 6 hours 25 minutes, but Garuda and Virgin are only fractionally slower by 5 minutes and 10 minutes respectively.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Both Australian airways offer standard recliner seats on this route but Garuda has the superior option of angled flat seats. It is also the only one to offer Wi-Fi connectivity on board. This is because the Indonesian airline uses the Airbus A330 while the other two fly the Boeing 737 on this route.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The Virgin and Qantas Boeing 737-800s fly at a speed of 518 mph and at an altitude of 10,350 m. Garuda&#38;#39;s Airbus A330-300 flies at 540 mph and cruises at a height of 10,980 m.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h2 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;Airports in Bali&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Bali is a major international tourism destination but is served by a single airport, the Ngurah Rai International Airport (DPS). It is commonly referred to as the Denpasar International Airport. The complex is located at the southern tip of Bali island, a scant 2.5 km from the famous Kuta Beach.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;DPS is the nation&#38;#39;s third-busiest airport, and handles both domestic and international flights. It catered to over 10 million passengers in the first half of 2017 alone. However, DPS is nearing its maximum capacity and will likely be replaced by another airport within the coming decade.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The airport&#38;#39;s architecture draws heavily from the island&#38;#39;s Hindu culture, and there are statues of mythological creatures from the&#38;#160;&#60;em&#62;Ramayana&#60;/em&#62;&#38;#160;within the complex. Lounges contain children&#38;#39;s playgrounds, movie theaters and massage facilities.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Because Bali was the target of two previous Islamist terrorist attacks, over 800 security personnel are employed by the airport.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Thai Airways and Emirates are the only two airlines that offer first class cabins on the Sydney to Bangkok route.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;However, Emirates has the more luxurious option with individual suites in first class and lie-flat seats in business class aboard its Airbus A380 craft. Thai Airways uses Boeing 747s, which has lie flat seats in first class and angled flat seats in business.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Both airlines complete the journey with the same flight time of 9 hours 25 minutes.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;There are two international airports that serve the city of &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/city/to-bangkok-bkk&#34; title=&#34;first class airfares to Bangkok&#34;&#62;Bangkok&#60;/a&#62;. One is Don Mueang International Airport (DMK) and the other is Suvarnabhumi Airport (BKK).&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Don Mueang is one of the world&#38;#39;s oldest commercial airports, and the oldest of Asia&#38;#39;s airports still in operation. As of March 2012, it is supposed to transition into the hub for low-cost and domestic flights while Suvarnabhumi becomes the airport for international arrivals and departures.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;However, Don Mueang currently still handles both domestic and international flights, albeit at different terminals. It is located 17.6 miles (28.2 km) from Bangkok.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Suvarnabhumi Airport is commonly called New Bangkok Airport and has been in operation since 2006. It is located 16 miles (25 km) east of Bangkok city and is known for the having the world&#38;#39;s tallest free-standing control tower at 434 feet (132.2 meters).&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;It handled 55.9 million passengers in 2016.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;On board, enjoy good food and wine amidst plush settings while being entertained by the latest music, movies and digital publications.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Flying in premium class is enjoyable, but Bora Bora is one of the most remote places in the world and getting there is an adventure in itself. There are certainly no direct flights from Sydney - all flights that land on Bora Bora originate in one of the islands of French Polynesia.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Flying from Sydney, you will have to make at least three stops before you reach Bora Bora. There are no options to fly in first class on any of the four legs of the journey. However, there are business class cabins available on the first leg from Sydney to Auckland which lasts 3 hours 15 minutes.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;You have two options to reach Bora Bora, the shorter of which takes 21 hours 10 minutes and the other that takes 40 minutes longer. The first two legs for both choices are identical. You first fly from Sydney &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/city/to-auckland-akl&#34; title=&#34;business class tickets to Auckland&#34;&#62;to Auckland&#60;/a&#62; in 3 hours 15 minutes, then transit there for 2 hours 5 minutes. You then take the 5-hour flight to Papeete.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The Papeete stopover is 9 hours 30 minutes for the shorter option, after which you take a 40-minute flight to Huahine. There is a 15-minute layover before you fly to Motu Mute Airport (BOB) on Bora Bora.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;With the longer journey, the Papeete layover is 10 hours 10 minutes long. This is followed by a 15-minute flight to Moorea (MOZ), a 15-minute layover, and then a 50-minute flight to Bora Bora&#38;#8217;s Motu Mute Airport.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;With either option, all legs but the first are on turbo-prop aircraft operated by Air Tahiti. The timings given here are based on beginning your journey with a LATAM Airlines flight from Sydney to Auckland. Other airways also fly this initial route but this option saves you the most time.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h2 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;Airports in Bora Bora&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;There is only one airport on Boora Bora &#38;ndash; Motu Mute (BOB). Located on an island in the middle of a lagoon, it is equipped only to handle the small propeller craft operated by Air Tahiti. You will need to transfer by boat to get from the airport island to the main island.&#60;/p&#62;

How many would have predicted not too long ago that you could have two showers while cruising high above the earth between two continents?</summary><body>&#60;h2 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;Advantages of Flying First Class&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Yet, this is where first class travel is today, astounding us with the sheer ingenuity that has been invested in making the travel experience unlike any other. Airlines even feature buffets and bars at which you can sit with friends while you fly. The food and wine are exceptional, and service seldom, if ever, leaves room for improvement.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;You can have a taste of all this, and more, if you decide to fly from Sydney to Dubai.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The national carriers of Australia and the U.A.E. both give you the options of direct flights between the two cities. While both airlines use the Airbus A380-800 quad-jet on this route, there is a difference in their cabin layouts.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;While Qantas features lie-flat seats in first class, which are extremely comfortable in their own right, Emirates goes the extra mile by giving each first class passenger their own individual enclosed suite. Both airlines offer lie-flat beds in business class.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;The flight times are virtually identical - 14 hours 20 minutes for Emirates and 14 hours 45 minutes for Qantas. The former flies at 560 mph at an altitude of 9,750 m while the latter cruises at 548 mph at an altitude of 10,980 m.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h2 style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;;&#34;&#62;Airports in Dubai&#60;/h2&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;All flights between the cities of Sydney and Dubai take off and land at Dubai International Airport (DXB) in the Arab nation. It is the busiest airport in the world by passenger numbers, and is also listed in the Guinness Book of World Records for a number of other feats.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;DXB is the largest airline hub in the Middle East, built over a land area of 2,900 hectares (7,200 acres). Dubai Airport&#38;#8217;s Terminal 3 building is the largest airport terminal in the world. The massive complex is also the world&#38;#8217;s largest building by floor space.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p style=&#34;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#38;quot;Times New Roman&#38;quot;; font-size: medium;&#34;&#62;Extraordinary security and anti-narcotics measures are in place at DXB. Every foreigner who arrives here is subject to a retinal scan. U.A.E. applies the same policy to all airports in the country. There is also a very advanced drug detection system in place, capable of recognizing illegal substances in quantities as low as 0.001 grams.&#60;/p&#62;
