    &#60;h3&#62;Business Class Tickets to Hong Kong&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Hong Kong&#38;#160;(香港 Heūng g&#38;oacute;ng in Cantonese, meaning fragrant harbour) is a place with multiple personalities, as a result of being both Cantonese Chinese and under a more recent contemporary ex-British influence. Today, the former British colony is a major tourism destination for China&#38;#8217;s increasingly affluent mainland population. It is also an important hub in East Asia with global connections to many of the world&#38;#8217;s cities. It is a unique destination that has absorbed people and cultural influences from places as diverse as Vietnam and Vancouver and proudly proclaims itself to be Asia&#38;#8217;s World City.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Best deals on business class to Hong Kong.&#38;#160;Hong Kong&#38;#160;is frequently described as a place where &#38;#8220;East meets West&#38;#8221;, reflecting the culture&#38;#8217;s mix of the territory&#38;#8217;s Chinese roots with influences from its time as a British colony. Hong Kong balances a modernised way of life with traditional Chinese practices. Concepts like feng shui are taken very seriously, with expensive construction projects often hiring expert consultants, and are often believed to make or break a business. Other objects like Ba gua mirrors are still regularly used to deflect evil spirits, and buildings often lack any floor number that has a 4 in it, due to its similarity to the word for &#38;#8220;die&#38;#8221; in Cantonese. The fusion of east and west also characterises Hong Kong&#38;#8217;s cuisine, where dim sum, hot pot, and fast food restaurants coexist with haute cuisine.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Hong Kong is a recognised global centre of trade, and calls itself an &#38;#8220;entertainment hub&#38;#8221;. Its martial arts film genre gained a high level of popularity in the late 1960s and 1970s. Several Hollywood performers, notable actors and martial artists have originated from Hong Kong cinema, notably Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Chow Yun-fat, Michelle Yeoh, Maggie Cheung and Jet Li. A number of Hong Kong film-makers have achieved widespread fame in Hollywood, such as John Woo, Wong Kar-wai, and Stephen Chow. Homegrown films such as Chungking Express, Infernal Affairs, Shaolin Soccer, Rumble in the Bronx, In the Mood for Love and Echoes of the Rainbow have gained international recognition. Hong Kong is the centre for Cantopop music,which draws its influence from other forms of Chinese music and Western genres, and has a multinational fanbase.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Hong Kong International Airport (IATA: HKG; ICAO: VHHH) which is also known as Chek Lap Kok 赤鱲角 (named after the small island it was built over), is the main port for visitors&#38;#160;to Hong Kong by air.&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;Designed by Sir Norman Foster, this modern and efficient building opened in July 1998 and has since been named &#38;#8220;World&#38;#8217;s Best Airport&#38;#8221; by Skytrax in annual ratings five times.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;There are many&#38;#160;direct flights to Hong Kong&#38;#160;from every continent in the world. Most major cities in Oceania, Europe and North America are all served with at least one&#38;#160;daily flight, and&#38;#160;flights between Hong Kong&#38;#160;and other major Asian cities are also frequent.&#38;#160;Cathay Pacific&#38;#160;operates one of the longest air routes in the world, linking Hong Kong and New York(JFK).&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;For destinations within mainland China, it is often cheaper to fly from Shenzhen than from Hong Kong, as flights between the mainland and Hong Kong are considered to be international flights and priced accordingly. There are also flights between Hong Kong and several mid-Pacific islands and nations.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Cathay Pacific and its subsidiary airline Dragonair (used for domestic routes within China) are Hong Kong&#38;#8217;s main carriers, with Hong Kong Airlines and Hong Kong Express providing some welcome competition. There are two terminals, creatively called T1 and T2. Signs on approach to the&#38;#160;&#60;strong&#62;airport&#60;/strong&#62;&#38;#160;by car/taxi list the terminals and check-in zones. Once checked-in, you can clear security at either terminal with an underground shuttle bus outside the security area. There are more shopping opportunities before security at T2, but its shops close earlier. There are lots of shopping opportunities after security as well. Travellers will find an efficient post office in the airport, providing boxes, wrapping material, scissors and tape. It might be more economical to send your excess luggage via surface mail than paying fees to the airline. Terminal 2 is a check-in only facility, all flights depart from Terminal 1. Airport has free wifi facility (captive portal to accept terms and conditions) and a hotline (2188 7799).&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;There is a manned left luggage facility in the arrival hall, perfect for securely storing your luggage at the airport, for around $55-$80 per day (depending on duration): it opens from 06:00 to 01:00.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Overall, services at Chek Lap Kok are generally far better, or at least on par, with those at other major international airports.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Cheap Tokyo Business Class Flights&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Tōkyō&#38;#160;(東京) is the capital of Japan. At over 12 million people in the official metropolitan area alone, Tokyo is the core of the most populated urban area in the world, Greater Tokyo (which has a population of 35 million people). This huge, wealthy and fascinating metropolis brings high-tech visions of the future side by side with glimpses of old Japan, and has something for everyone.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Over 500 years old, the city of Tokyo grew from the modest fishing village of Edo (江戸). The city only truly began to grow when it became the seat of the Tokugawa shogunate in 1603. While the emperor ruled in name from Kyoto, the true power was concentrated in the hands of the Tokugawa shogun in Edo. After the Meiji restoration in 1868, during which the Tokugawa family lost its influence, the emperor and the imperial family moved here from Kyoto, and the city was re-named to its current name, Tokyo. The metropolitan center of the country,&#38;#160;Tokyo is the destination for business, education, modern culture, and government.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Tokyo is vast: it&#38;#8217;s best thought of not as a single city, but a constellation of cities that have grown together. Tokyo&#38;#8217;s districts vary wildly by character, from the electronic blare of Akihabara to the Imperial gardens and shrines of Chiyoda, from the hyperactive youth culture mecca of Shibuya to the pottery shops and temple markets of Asakusa. If you don&#38;#8217;t like what you see, hop on the train and head to the next station, and you will find something entirely different.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;The sheer size and frenetic pace of&#38;#160;Tokyo&#38;#160;can intimidate the first-time visitor. Much of the city is a jungle of concrete and wires, with a mass of neon and blaring loudspeakers. At rush hour, crowds jostle in packed trains and masses of humanity sweep through enormous and bewilderingly complex stations.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;Don&#38;#8217;t get too hung up on ticking tourist sights off your list: for most visitors, the biggest part of the Tokyo experience is just wandering around at random and absorbing the vibe,&#38;#160;poking your head into shops selling weird and wonderful things, sampling restaurants where you can&#38;#8217;t recognize a single thing on the menu (or on your plate), and finding unexpected oases of calm in the tranquil grounds of a neighbourhood Shinto shrine. It&#38;#8217;s all perfectly safe, and the locals will go to sometimes extraordinary lengths to help you if you just ask.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;In Japan, all roads, rails, shipping lanes and planes lead to Tokyo.&#38;#160;Tokyo&#38;#160;has two large&#38;#160;airports: Narita for international flights, and Haneda for (mostly) domestic flights.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Tokyo&#38;#8217;s main international gateway is Narita Airport (成田空港) (IATA: NRT) [2], located in the town of Narita nearly 70 kilometers northeast of Tokyo and covered in a separate article. A brief summary of options for getting there and away:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Easiest: Limousine bus direct to major hotels, ~120 minutes (subject to traffic), &#38;yen;3,500&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Fastest: Skyliner to Nippori and Ueno Stations, under 45 minutes, &#38;yen;2,400; Narita Express to Tokyo Station, Shibuya, Shinjuku, Yokohama, 55 minutes and &#38;yen;2,940 to Tokyo Station (Japan Rail Pass valid)&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Cheapest: Keisei Limited Express/Access Tokkyu trains to Nippori/Ueno, 60-80 minutes, &#38;yen;1,000-1,200 (Access Tokkyu trains also serve some subway stations); &#38;#8220;Super Shuttle&#38;#8221; Bus to Ueno and Asakusa, &#38;yen;1,000&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Most expensive: Taxi to the city, more than &#38;yen;30,000; flat-fare cabs approximately &#38;yen;17,000-19,000&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Even defining the borders of this continent is difficult &#38;ndash; from the mountains around the Black Sea in the west, to the snow fields of Siberia in the east, there are more people and cities in Asia than outside of it.&#60;br /&#62;
    Band-e Haibat Lake in Afghanistan&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Asia&#38;#8217;s and the world&#38;#8217;s highest point is Mount Everest, along the border of Tibet (China) and Nepal, which rises to 8,848 m (29,028 feet) above sea level. Its lowest point is the Dead Sea, located at the meeting points of Israel, the Palestinian Territories, and Jordan, whose surface is 400 m (1,312 feet) below sea level. Asia&#38;#8217;s longest river is the Yangtze, which runs 6,300 km (3,915 miles) through China, from all the way from the high Tibetan Plateau to Shanghai. Its largest lake is the 386,400 sq km (149,200 square mile) Caspian Sea, which is surrounded by several Central Asian nations.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Asia is bounded by the Pacific Ocean to the east, by Australia to the south east, and by the Indian Ocean to the south. It is bordered by the Red Sea to the south west, by Europe and Urals to the west, and by the Arctic Ocean to the north.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Travel&#38;#160;options range widely, from the desert ruins and modern mega-malls of the&#38;#160;Middle East&#38;#160;to the magnificent ancient monuments in&#38;#160;South Asia, and from the beach bungalows and jungle treks of&#38;#160;South-East Asia&#38;#160;to the mega-cities and technology capitals of&#38;#160;East Asia.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;Asia offers very diverse travel options. There are ultra modern, largely democratic countries like Japan and the East Asian Tigers of Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea which are very prosperous and in which people enjoy very high standards of living. On the other hand, Afghanistan, Laos and East Timor are extremely poor countries where people struggle even to get a few grains of rice each day. Of course, there are also many countries lying somewhere in the middle, such as the emerging powerhouses of China and India which make wonderful travel destinations in themselves due to their long history, size and diversity. Thailand is a magnet for travellers, with great food, a tropical climate, fascinating culture and great beaches. Asia also contains North Korea, suffering under one of, if not the most, oppressive regimes in the world and, therefore, very safe for travellers.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Asia&#38;#8217;s largest airports by number of intercontinental connections include Tokyo, Beijing, Hong Kong, Bangkok, New Delhi, Mumbai and Singapore. Get the&#38;#160;best business class to asia&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Most visitors arrive via Incheon International Airport (IATA: ICN), located on Yeongjong Island in the neighboring city of Incheon and covered in detail in its own article.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The A&#38;#8217;REX train link connects the&#38;#160;airport to Seoul&#38;#160;Station (for further connections to KTX high-speed services) and Gimpo Airport (most domestic flights), operating from 5:20 AM until midnight. Two versions exist: Express services to the city (every half hour) takes 43 minutes and cost ₩13,300 (with WiFi available on board), while commuter services (every 6 minutes) take 53 minutes and cost ₩3,700.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;It is worth noting that with some airlines you can check into your Incheon&#38;#160;flight in Seoul&#38;#160;Station before you get on the AREX train. Immigration officers are also on hand to stamp your passport, which means you are processed and can quickly go through the Diplomatic Departures entrance in&#38;#160;Incheon Airport.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Travel time to&#38;#160;Gimpo Airport&#38;#160;is 28/35 minutes, with both services charging ₩3100, making this the fastest and cheap option for intra-airport transfer as well. If you are heading to Incheon&#38;#160;International&#38;#160;from Seoul Station and using&#38;#160;Korean,&#38;#160;Asiana&#38;#160;or&#38;#160;Jeju Air, the express train may be your best option. You can check your bags and even pass through security and immigration, allowing you to skip the lines at the airport and to spend a little longer in the city, or helping you make a mad dash to the airport.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;However, if you have a lot of luggage or are heading to southern parts of Seoul (eg. Gangnam), the airport buses remain your best option. Limousine buses (₩15,000 to/from city for one way, ₩6500 to/from&#38;#160;Gimpo Airport&#38;#160;(domestic flight)) travel directly to major areas and big hotels in Seoul, while public buses (₩8,000-9.000) will take you to major transit hubs. If you&#38;#8217;re visiting for the first time, it&#38;#8217;s worth paying a bit extra for the limousine bus. For either bus type, consult the big maps or staff to figure out which route best suits your needs; you can then find the shuttles outside 1st floor arrivals (if possible get this information from your hotel before arriving).&#38;#160;Or simply, walk out and ask the many ticket sellers (they are wearing vests) which bus goes to your hotel because if it&#38;#8217;s a popular one or in a popular area, they&#38;#8217;ll surely know which you&#38;#8217;ll need. It&#38;#8217;s best to buy tickets at any of the the ticket gates near the bus arrival area but you can also pay the fare using won or a T-Money card if you have one.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;The limousine bus drivers are extremely friendly but don&#38;#8217;t count on them knowing too much English. There are maps inside the buses letting passengers know which stops are upcoming and these are also announced in Korean and English. Pressing any of the red buttons inside signals to the driver you want off at the next stop.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;You can purchase and recharge a T-Money card at the GS25 store which is located at the end of the arrivals area, next to &#38;#8220;International Arrivals F&#38;#8221; exit.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;If you have a late flight and plan on getting into Seoul via bus, make sure you get out to the curb as soon as you can. The last buses run shortly after the last flights land. If you miss your bus, you&#38;#8217;ll be stuck paying for a taxi, as the trains will stop running too.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;A taxi direct to&#38;#160;Seoul&#38;#160;will cost around ₩50,000/70,000 regular/deluxe. Black deluxe taxis (모범 택시) and almost all regular taxis accept credit cards, but a few regular taxis (일반 택시) may not. Ask the driver before you get on if you can pay by credit card. You are expected to pay any road tolls on top of the meter fare. Having your destination written down in Korean will be very helpful. Steer clear of taxi drivers trying to pick you up from inside the terminal and even the bus stop. As both buses and taxis are subject to traffic, allow extra time for rush hour delays (or take the train back).&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Gimpo Airport&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The closer but older&#38;#160;Gimpo Airport&#38;#160;(김포국제공항, GMP) caters only to the shuttle services to Tokyo-Haneda, Osaka-Kansai and Shanghai-Hongqiao, as well as domestic flights within South Korea.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Gimpo Airport is easily reached on the A&#38;#8217;REX link from Seoul Station or Incheon Airport, as well as subway lines 5 and 9. All lines intersect Line 2 which runs in a large circle through Seoul. Line 9 (Gold Line), a private subway line in Seoul, has three express trains per hour. Travelers coming into Seoul should first have detailed directions to their destination from the nearest station then consult the subway map before deciding on which line and route to take. All three lines cost ₩1,000-2,100 (depending on distance), while a taxi to central Seoul will run around ₩30,000. Discounts for subway fare are available with T-Money cards.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The largest&#38;#160;air travel hubs in Europe&#38;#160;are, in order,&#38;#160;London&#38;#160;(LON: LCY, LHR, LGW, STN, LTN),&#38;#160;Frankfurt&#38;#160;(FRA, HHN),&#38;#160;Paris&#38;#160;(CDG, ORY),&#38;#160;Madrid&#38;#160;(MAD), and&#38;#160;Amsterdam&#38;#160;(AMS) which in turn have connections to practically everywhere in&#38;#160;Europe. However, nearly every European city has direct long-distance flights at least to some destinations elsewhere, and other smaller airports can make sense for specific connections: for example, Vienna (VIE) has a very good network of&#38;#160;flights to&#38;#160;the Middle East and&#38;#160;Eastern Europe, while Helsinki (HEL) is the geographically closest place to transfer if coming in from East Asia.&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;London&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Due to London&#38;#8217;s huge global city status it is the most served destination in the world when it comes to&#38;#160;flights.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;London&#60;/strong&#62;&#38;#160;(all airports code: LON) is served by a total of five airports. Travelling between the city and the airports is made relatively easy by the large number of public transport links that have been put in place over recent years. However, if transiting through London, be sure to check the arrival and departure airports carefully as transfers across the city may be quite time consuming. In addition to London&#38;#8217;s five official airports (of which only two are located within Greater London), there are a number of other regional UK airports conveniently accessible from London. Since they offer a growing number of budget flights, choosing those airports can be cheaper (or even faster, depending on where in London your destination is).&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;For transfers directly between London&#38;#8217;s airports, the fastest way (short of a taxi) is the direct inter-airport bus service by National Express. Buses between Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and Luton run at least hourly, with Heathrow-Gatwick services taking 65 min (&#38;pound;18) and Heathrow-Stansted services 90 min (&#38;pound;20.50) (note that services between Stansted and Luton run only every two hours). However, it&#38;#8217;s essential to allow leeway, as London&#38;#8217;s expressways, especially the orbital M25 and the M1 motorway, are often congested to the point of gridlock. Some buses have toilets on board.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Frankfurt&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Frankfurt&#38;#160;is the heart of central Germany and as such, it is the national transportation hub. It has excellent connections by rail, road and air. Reaching and leaving Frankfurt is easy.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Frankfurt Airport&#38;#160;(IATA: FRA) is among the busiest in Europe &#38;mdash; third in passenger traffic after&#38;#160;London Heathrow&#38;#160;and&#38;#160;Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport&#38;#160;&#38;mdash; and the ninth busiest airport in the world. Frankfurt is the banking center of Germany and hosts numerous international trade fairs. Therefore all major airlines and all airline alliances fly frequently to Frankfurt and connects it to every continent and major city in the world. The German flagcarrier Lufthansa is the main airline in Frankfurt and offers the best connections.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The airport has two terminals (A third is scheduled to be opened in 2015). Terminal 1 is the home of Lufthansa and the Star Alliance airlines. Terminal 2 is for all other airlines. Terminal 1 is separated into Concourses A (inside Schengen passport control), Z (the level on top of A, outside passport control), B and C; Terminal 2 is separated into Concourses D and E. Terminal 1 is a multi-level maze with poor signage &#38;amp; changing entrances due to ongoing construction work and insufficient capacity. Lufthansa tries to ease the confusion, therefore Business Class passengers (+ Gold &#38;amp; Silver Star Alliance Card Holders) have a designated check in area in Terminal 1 A. First class passengers of Lufthansa &#38;amp; Swiss Int&#38;#8217;l Airlines (+ LH HON Circle card holders) are allowed to check-in in the separate First Class terminal [7] on the right side of Terminal 1, which has its own driveway. All Star Alliance economy class travelers and other Star Alliance partners are checked in in Terminal 1B &#38;amp; 1C. The terminals are connected by the Sky Train (both landside and airside).&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The departure gates have some of the most innovative seating around, with bench seats facing many directions and cafe-style tables and chairs for those who wish to whip out their laptops (sans coffee, alas). Passengers requiring special assistance should be advised that they might have to descend several flights of stairs to get to a bus that takes them to the plane, rather than disability-friendly ramps, so talk to the gate agent early if stairs are a problem.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Terminal 1 has public showers for &#38;euro;6 (includes towel, foot mat, shower gel, and hair dryer). One location is in the B Departures area, in the Shopping Boulevard, across from &#38;#8220;TUMI&#38;#8221;. The other is in the secure area of B Concourse (good for transit passengers), Level 2, near gate B 30 and the duty free shopping. There is luggage storage in both terminals for &#38;euro;5 per bag per day.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Wireless internet access is available. 30 minutes is &#38;#8220;free&#38;#8221;, but requires receiving an SMS (text message), which isn&#38;#8217;t free if you have to pay to receive an SMS or can&#38;#8217;t receive an SMS in Germany. More time is available by paying (e.g., &#38;euro;5 for 1 hour, &#38;euro;10 for a significantly longer period).&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The airport has a long visitor terrace on top of terminal 2 (adults &#38;euro;4). It also offers 45-minute airside bus tours (adults &#38;euro;6, hourly from 11 (holidays) or 1-4PM, ticket booth is at the bridge between terminal 1 and &#38;#8220;Frankfurt Airport Centre&#38;#8221;, follow signs and information for Flughafen Erlebnisfahrten (&#38;#8220;Airport Experience Tour&#38;#8221;).&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Amsterdam&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Amsterdam Airport Schiphol&#38;#160;(IATA: AMS) (ICAO: EHAM) is one of the busiest airports in the world, situated 15 km south-west of the city.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The national carrier for the Netherlands is KLM, now merged with Air France. With partner Delta Air Lines they offer worldwide connections. The US, Asia and Europe are particularly well served at Schiphol. British Airways offer up to 15 flights per day to 3 London Airports; Heathrow, Gatwick and London City.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Transavia, Jet2.com, Easyjet, and other&#38;#160;low-cost carriers&#38;#160;serve Schiphol, providing a fairly economical way to city-hop to Amsterdam from other spots in Europe.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;When leaving Amsterdam, give yourself enough time to get to your plane and through security (especially when flying to the United States)! Schiphol is a large airport &#38;mdash; be there at least 2 hrs in advance. If you have time to kill, drop into the Rijksmuseum&#38;#8217;s Schiphol branch, between E and F Pier (non-Schengen area airside), which is free and open 07:00-20:00 daily.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Coin-operated storage lockers are located along the main hallway through the transit/departure area, across from the start of the E wing. From &#38;euro;6 per 24 hr, maximum one week.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;line-height: 1.6em;&#34;&#62;There are plenty of fast-food chains and restaurants at the airport. It even has the busiest Burger King in the world with 1.3 million visitors a year. It has never closed since its opening in 1993. McDonald&#38;#8217;s has three branches in and around the airport.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Paris&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Paris&#38;#160;is served by three international airports&#38;#160;&#38;ndash; for more information, including arrival/departure times, check the official sites.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
    Charles de Gaulle International Airport&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;ICAO: LFPG, IATA: CDG. The major hub airport to the north-east of the city. It&#38;#8217;s notoriously confusing, so allow plenty of time for transfers. There are three terminals: Terminal 1, Terminal 2 (which is huge and subdivided into 2A through 2G), and Terminal 3 (formerly T9). The newest exception is terminal 2G which is a separate building and is only reachable via navette/bus in 10-15 min (bus leaves every 20 min) so allow extra time. The free CDGVAL shuttle train connects the terminals together. Everything at this airport is very expensive, especially food. If you&#38;#8217;re traveling from Terminal 1 it&#38;#8217;s also worth noting that the food court is located at the CDGVAL floor, before the security check. There are hardly any benches around. There are no public shower facilities in the airport.&#38;#160;Air France lounges&#38;#160;have such facilities, and the departure lounges have showers. Lounge access is included for&#38;#160;Air France business and first class travelers. The members of the Air France and cooperating frequent flyer programs may gain access with sufficient status. There is a possibility that some lounges may grant access to travelers on their flights for a fee. If you consider paying for access to the lounge, inquire when checking in for your departure. If you must have a shower and your frequent flyer status (and charm) are insufficient to gain entry to a lounge, the airport hotels generally have rooms available (in Sep 2009, the Sheraton in Terminal 2 at the train station charged &#38;euro;155). When you arrive at CDG, you should note what terminal you arrived at (2A, 2D, etc.), because when you come back to the airport to depart at the end of your trip, the RER subway train makes two stops at CDG to cover the three terminals, but there are few indications of which airlines are at which terminals. Have a close look at your air ticket to figure out which terminal you are departing from. Air France and associates leave from Terminal 2. The RER B has the airlines serviced by each terminal on a not so obvious chart posted by the door of the train.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Orly International Airport&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;(ICAO: LFPO, IATA: ORY. This airport is southwest of the city, and served by a southern branch of the RER-B line that heads in the direction of Saint-R&#38;eacute;my-les-Chevreuse (not Robinson). This older&#38;#160;international airport&#38;#160;is used mainly by Air France for domestic departures, and&#38;#160;international departures by European carriers.&#38;#160;Orly is roughly 40 min from Paris via the OrlyBus, which departs from M&#38;eacute;tro Denfert-Rochereau (ligne 6); the price is &#38;euro;7. There are buses every 10 minutes from the Orly Sud (Platform 4) and it stops at Orly Ouest on its way to the city. Tickets can be bought at a counter near the baggage claim area or directly at the counter in Platform 4. The tickets need to be validated once on the bus. Another option is bus 285 that takes you to the M&#38;eacute;tro Villejuif &#38;ndash; Louis Aragon(Line 7) in 15 min, but it stops on the way and is designed for commuters and not for travellers. Bus 285 costs &#38;euro;1.90 and runs every 10 min, stopping at airport level -1.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The Orlyval light rail connects the two terminals to each other and to the RER B line at Antony. It runs every 4-7 min and cost &#38;euro;10.75 for transfer to Paris, including connections to central area metro stations. The RER B from Antony runs through Paris to A&#38;eacute;roport Charles de Gaulle.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Beauvais (A&#38;eacute;roport de Beauvais Till&#38;eacute;)&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;ICAO: LFOB, IATA: BVA. This airport, a distance north of the city, is a smaller regional airport that is used by some low-cost carriers such as Ryanair (list flights [10]) and WizzAir. Like many small airports there is a cartel in operation in the form of the airport operated shuttle service connecting with the M&#38;eacute;tro at Porte Maillot station. Buses run even during the small hours of the morning (6AM). Buses leave 20 min after each flight arrives, and a few hours before each flight departs. Exact times can be found on the Beauvais Airport website. The journey will take about an hour in good traffic conditions, and costs &#38;euro;15 each way, there is no reduced price for children over the age of 2 years. Unless you hire a car this is the most realistic way to head toward Paris, hence why the airport charge the price they do.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Madrid&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Madrid&#38;#160;Barajas International Airport(IATA: MAD), +34 902 404 704, is located 13km from the city center. It is one of the&#38;#160;largest airports in Europe&#38;#160;and is serviced by many airlines, as well as being the homebase for Iberia Airlines. The airport has 4 terminals, including Terminal 4, a new terminal that has won architectural awards, and might be worth the trip to have a look even if you are not flying.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;By far the most convenient way of reaching downtown is a 24-hours express bus service that passes all terminals and then goes direct to O&#38;#8217;Donell, Cibeles (20 minutes walk or quick metro ride to Puerta del Sol) and Atocha (main train station, not serviced between 11:30 PM and 6 AM). 5 euros. Departures every 12(day)-35(late night) minutes. Travel time Terminal 4 (end of line) &#38;ndash; Cibeles 30-40 minutes.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The airport is also connected to the city by Cercanias commuter train (line C-1, from 05:30 to 23:30, &#38;euro;2.15) and Metro (line 8 pink, from 06:30 to 01:30, to/from the airport &#38;euro;5.00). From Terminal 4 take the commuter train (look for Renfe Cercanias) to &#38;#8220;Nuevos Ministerios&#38;#8221; and then transfer to line C-3 or C-4 southbound on platform 8; Sol will be the first stop. Alternatively, you can also take the Metro to Nuevos Ministerios from any terminal but it will probably take a bit longer.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Public bus 200 operates between the airport and Avenida de Am&#38;eacute;rica bus station in Madrid. It is only 2.00&#38;euro; and you can use your weekly ticket or 10-trips ticket. Public night bus N4 goes from Plaza Cibeles to Barajas district, 400m walk from the terminal through a passageway over the highway. Night Shuttle [4] operates a night bus between the airport and city center for &#38;euro;9.90 per person. Taxis from the airport to the city center cost ~&#38;euro;32.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Two smaller airports, Torrej&#38;oacute;n and Cuatro Vientos, also serve the city, however, there are no commercial flights coming in or out of these two airports.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Save big on cheapest business class flights to Narita.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Narita Airport (成田空港 Narita-kūkō, IATA: NRT ICAO: RJAA), located nearly 70 kilometers northeast of Tokyo, is Japan&#38;#8217;s largest international airport. The airport is generally modern and efficient, but sometimes overcrowded (particularly at immigration). Security has been rather heavy, especially when coming in, due to continuing controversy over land expropriated for the airport &#38;ndash; there are plans in the works, however, to relax the checkpoints at train stations and possibly the entry gates for vehicles as part of the first security overhaul since the airport&#38;#8217;s 1978 opening.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The airport has two terminals connected by both train and bus. Foreign airlines operate out of either terminal, with Japanese carriers ANA and JAL operating out of terminals 1 and 2, respectively.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The South Wing of Terminal 1 opened in June of 2006, and now most airlines in the Star Alliance (e.g. ANA, Asiana Airlines,United, Continental, Air Canada, SAS) operate out of that section (although Air New Zealand operates from Terminal 2). Carriers in the other two major airline alliances are also grouped together: the Skyteam Alliance (e.g. Air France, China Southern, Delta, KLM, Korean Air) operates out of the North Wing of Terminal 1, and the OneWorld Alliance (e.g. JAL, American, British Airways, Finnair) operates out of Terminal 2. Check the airport&#38;#8217;s website just prior to your departure to determine the terminal you will arrive at. On the way to the airport, there are also lists (in English) posted near the doors of trains going to Narita.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;There are Citibank cash machines that accept international ATM/credit cards once you leave customs on the arrivals floor of both terminals, as well as ATM machines operated by Japan Post. Recently, 7-Eleven affiliated Seven Bank ATMs accepting foreign cards can also be found throughout the airport.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;There are many ways to travel between Narita Airport and central Tokyo. For a first-time visitor, suffering jet-lag, laden with luggage and holding a reservation for a major hotel, the easiest option is often to take the Limousine Bus direct to the hotel. A close second is taking one of the express trains to Tokyo or Ueno Station and then transferring to a taxi for the final leg. If taking the bus, note that traffic jams can cause you to reach your destination a lot later than you were told when you boarded.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;When departing Narita, the better shops and restaurants are located in the check-in area: after passing security and immigration, all that&#38;#8217;s really available is expensive duty-free and some convenience store sundries. But remember that Japan restricts liquids in carry-on baggage, and plan to buy drinks for the plane after security.If you&#38;#8217;re at Narita for a connecting flight, you may wish to use the dayrooms and showers inside the terminal, past security. Dayrooms are paid for by the hour; &#38;yen;1000 for the first hour and &#38;yen;500 for each additional hour. The dayroom consists of a bed and a bathroom with a shower. It&#38;#8217;s a great way to refresh yourself before your next flight.&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;If you just want to take a shower, you can get a shower room for &#38;yen;500 for a half hour. Soap and shampoo are provided, but not things like toothbrushes, toothpaste, shavers, and deodorant, so bring them in your carry-on with your change of clothes. Twin dayrooms are available for &#38;yen;1600 for the first hour and &#38;yen;800 for each additional hour. Dayroom reservations can be made up to a month in advance.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;WiFi access is available throughout the airport. There are several WiFi desks located in both terminals which have 100-volt power ports and free Internet access. Elsewhere in the airport you can connect to the Internet with the SSID NRT-AIRPORT at a cost of &#38;yen;500 per 24 hours. In the near future, free WiFi will be available both in the departure counter area and the airside waiting area.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The vast majority of Narita&#38;#8217;s visitors come there for one reason only: Narita Airport, Tokyo&#38;#8217;s international gateway. But there are a few attractions in the vicinity if you have a short layover and don&#38;#8217;t want to waste 2-3 hours of it on the long hike to Tokyo. Firstly, Narita town itself is very charming with lots of quaint winding old streets lined with old wooden shops. The pace of life here is dramatically different to that of nearby Tokyo and is very relaxed. This is a major congregation point for airline staff too so you can take it that most of the foreigners in town are Air Crew. This means there&#38;#8217;s a bit more to Narita&#38;#8217;s nightlife than may seem at first in this sleepy town.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Get Your&#38;#160;Business Class Flights Discount&#38;#160;&#38;#160;to Australia&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Australia is the only country that has a whole continent to itself. World famous for its natural wonders and wide open spaces, its beaches, deserts, &#38;#8220;the bush&#38;#8221;, and &#38;#8220;the Outback&#38;#8221;, Australia is actually one of the world&#38;#8217;s most highly urbanised countries. It is also well known for the cosmopolitan attractions of its large cities such as Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Australia is the smallest continent but sixth-largest country by land area. It is comparable in size to the 48 contiguous United States. Australia is bordered to the west by the Indian Ocean, and to the east by the South Pacific Ocean. The Tasman Sea lies to the southeast, separating it from New Zealand, while the Coral Sea lies to the northeast. Papua New Guinea, East Timor and Indonesia are Australia&#38;#8217;s northern neighbours, separated from Australia by the Arafura Sea and the Timor Sea.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Australia is highly urbanised with most of the population heavily concentrated along the eastern and south-eastern coasts. Most of the inland areas of the country are semi-arid. The most-populous states are Victoria and New South Wales, but by far the largest in land area is Western Australia.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Australia has an area of 7,682,300 square kilometres (2,966,152 sq mi) and the distances between cities and towns is easy to underestimate.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Australia has large areas that have been deforested for agricultural purposes, but many native forest areas survive in extensive national parks and other undeveloped areas. Long-term Australian concerns include salinity, pollution, loss of biodiversity, and management and conservation of coastal areas, especially the Great Barrier Reef.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Popular Cities in Australia&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Canberra&#38;#160;&#38;mdash; the purpose-built national capital of Australia&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Adelaide&#38;#160;&#38;mdash; the City of Churches, a relaxed South Australian alternative to the big eastern cities&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Brisbane&#38;#160;&#38;mdash; capital of sun-drenched Queensland and gateway to beautiful sandy beaches&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Cairns&#38;#160;&#38;mdash; gateway to the Great Barrier Reef, Port Douglas, Daintree National Park, and many beautiful beaches and resorts; a great place for people to getaway to and relax&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Darwin&#38;#160;&#38;mdash; Australia&#38;#8217;s tropical northern capital, at the top end of the Northern Territory&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Hobart&#38;#160;&#38;mdash; picturesque and quiet capital of Tasmania, the site of the second convict settlement in Australia&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Melbourne&#38;#160;&#38;mdash; Australia&#38;#8217;s second largest city, Melbourne is a large sporting, shopping and cultural capital; it is regarded as Australia&#38;#8217;s most European city in style&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Perth&#38;#160;&#38;mdash; the most remote continental capital city on Earth, on the south-western edge of Western Australia&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Sydney&#38;#160;&#38;mdash; Australia&#38;#8217;s oldest and largest city, famous for its picturesque harbour&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;
    &#60;p&#62;Australia is a long way from anywhere else in the world, so for most visitors, the only practical way of getting into Australia is by air.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Approximately half of all international travelers arrive first in Australia in&#38;#160;Sydney (SYD), the largest city. After Sydney, significant numbers of travelers also arrive in Australia in Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth. There are also direct international services into Adelaide, Cairns, Darwin, the Gold Coast and Christmas Island though these are largely restricted to flights from New Zealand, Oceania, or Southeast Asia.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;To Sydney it is a 3 hour flight from New Zealand, a 7-11 hour flight from countries in Asia, a 14 hour flight from the west of the United States and Canada, a 14 hour flight from Johannesburg, a 13-16 hours flight from South America, and up to a 24+ hour flight from western Europe. On account of long journey times from some destinations, some travelers from Europe opt to have a stop-over, commonly in Singapore, Hong Kong, Dubai, Bangkok or Kuala Lumpur.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;If you have to change to a domestic flight in a gateway city, Sydney, Brisbane and Perth all have distinct domestic terminals, requiring some time and complexity to transit, check the guides. Melbourne, Adelaide, Darwin, Cairns and the Gold Coast have all gates in the one terminal building or within easy walking distance of each other.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Discount Airlines&#60;br /&#62;
    There are some routes into Australia that are operated by discount airlines. These can often be combined with other fares to make getting to Australia cheaper. Select your point of entry and exit to give you a cheaper round-trip, and possibly some interesting stopover opportunities on the way.&#60;/p&#62;
    &#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Air Asia X, flies into the Gold Coast, Melbourne and Perth from Kuala Lumpur, at often deeply discounted fares. You can save money from Europe if having a stopover in Malaysia. Sometimes this is possible also stopping in Bangkok.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Air Asia Indonesia flies into Darwin and Perth from Denpasar, Indonesia&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Tiger flies from Singapore to Perth.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Jetstar Airways flies to Hawaii and several Asian destinations, including Denpasar, Osaka, Phuket, Ho Chi Minh, and also operates a substantial Asian regional hub in Singapore.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;V Australia flies between Melbourne, Brisbane, Sydney, and Los Angeles, and competes strongly with Qantas on these routes.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

Even defining the borders of this continent is difficult &#38;ndash; from the mountains around the Black Sea in the west, to the snow fields of Siberia in the east, there are more people and cities in Asia than outside of it. Asia&#38;#8217;s and the world&#38;#8217;s highest point is Mount Everest, along the border of Tibet (China) and Nepal, which rises to 8,848 m (29,028 feet) above sea level. Its lowest point is the Dead Sea, located at the meeting points of Israel, the Palestinian Territories, and Jordan, whose surface is 400 m (1,312 feet) below sea level. Asia&#38;#8217;s longest river is the Yangtze, which runs 6,300 km (3,915 miles) through China from all the way from the high Tibetan Plateau to Shanghai. Its largest lake is the 386,400 sq km (149,200 square mile) Caspian Sea, which is surrounded by several Central Asian nations. Asia is bounded by the Pacific Ocean to the east, by Australia to the southeast, and by the Indian Ocean to the south. It is bordered by the Red Sea to the southwest, by Europe and Urals to the west, and by the Arctic Ocean to the north.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Travel options range widely, from the desert ruins and modern mega-malls of the Middle East to the magnificent ancient monuments in South Asia, and from the beach bungalows and jungle treks of South-East Asia to the mega-cities and technology capitals of East Asia.

    &#60;p&#62;In any case, Asia offers the very diverse travel options available to the most avid travelers. On one end, there are the ultramodern largely democratic modern countries/territories like Japan and the East Asian Tigers of Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea which are very prosperous and in which people enjoy very high standards of living. On the other hand, Afghanistan, Laos and East Timor are extremely poor countries where people struggle even to get a few grains of rice each day. Of course, there are also many countries lying somewhere in the middle, such as the emerging powerhouses of China and India which make&#38;#160;wonderful travel destinations&#38;#160;in themselves due to their long history, size and diversity.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Thailand is a magnet for travelers too, with great food, a tropical climate, fascinating culture and great beaches. To add to a list of possible travel destinations, Asia is also home to North Korea, which is under one of, if not the most, oppressive regimes in the world.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Due to the vast distances and expanses of water separating Asia&#38;#8217;s different regions,&#38;#160;air travel&#38;#160;is likely to be the preferred mode of transport between the regions many travel destinations. Fares are lower on average than in Europe or America, and low cost airlines in Asia are rapidly expanding their networks particularly in Southeast Asia.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Cheapest Business Class Flights to Europe&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;We have the best&#38;#160;business class flights to Europe.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;Europe encompasses an area of 10,180,000 km2 (3,930,000 square miles), stretching from Asia to the Atlantic, and from Africa to the Arctic. European countries welcome more than 480 million international visitors per year, more than half of the global market, and 7 of the 10 most visited countries are European nations. It&#38;#8217;s easy to see why &#38;ndash; a well preserved cultural heritage, open borders and efficient infrastructure makes visiting Europe a breeze, and rarely will you have to travel more than a few hours before you can immerse yourself in a new culture, and dive into a different phrasebook. Although it is the world&#38;#8217;s smallest continent in land surface area, there are profound differences between the cultures and ways of life in its countries.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Popular European Cities:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Amsterdam&#38;#160;&#38;mdash; canals, Rembrandt, hashish and red lanterns, the epicenter of liberal attitudes&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Athens&#38;#160;&#38;mdash; the cradle of western civilization is teeming with historic monuments&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Barcelona&#38;#160;&#38;mdash; Gaudi&#38;#8217;s cosmopolitan home on Mediterranean coast&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Istanbul&#38;#160;&#38;mdash; the only major city to span two continents and a fascinating melting pot of East and West&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;London&#38;#160;&#38;mdash; Britain&#38;#8217;s vibrant and truly multicultural capital&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Moscow&#38;#160;&#38;mdash; Europe&#38;#8217;s largest city is famous for its nightlife and the iconic Kremlin&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Paris&#38;#160;&#38;mdash; the capital of romance (and France) on the banks of the Seine&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Prague&#38;#160;&#38;mdash; magical city with its renowned bridges spanning the Vltava River&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Rome&#38;#160;&#38;mdash; the eternal city of seven hills and two thousand seven hundred years of history&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Other Popular European Destinations:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Alhambra&#38;#160;&#38;mdash; part fortress, part palace, part garden, and part government city, a stunning mediaeval complex overlooking Granada&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Alps&#38;#160;&#38;mdash; very popular mountain range for skiing/snowboarding and mountaineering, with Mont Blanc as its highest peak&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Cinque Terre&#38;#160;&#38;mdash; a gorgeous national park, which connects five picturesque villages&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Białowieża National Park&#38;#160;&#38;mdash; the last and largest remaining parts of the immense primeval forest that once spread across the European Plain&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Blue Lagoon&#38;#160;&#38;mdash; amazing geothermal spa with the water temperature around 40 &#38;deg;C all year round, even in freezing conditions&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Meteora&#38;#160;&#38;mdash; six Eastern Orthodox monasteries built on natural sandstone rock pillars&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Neuschwanstein Castle&#38;#160;&#38;mdash; the well-known fairy-tale castle in the Bavarian Alps in Germany&#60;/li&#62;

    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The largest air travel hubs in Europe are, in order,&#38;#160;London (LON: LCY, LHR, LGW, STN, LTN),&#38;#160;Frankfurt (FRA, HHN), Paris (CDG, ORY),&#38;#160;Madrid (MAD), and&#38;#160;Amsterdam (AMS)&#38;#160;which in turn have connections to practically everywhere in Europe. However, nearly every European city has direct long-distance flights at least to some destinations elsewhere, and other smaller airports can make sense for specific connections: for example,Vienna (VIE)&#38;#160;has a very good network of flights to the Middle East and Eastern Europe, while&#38;#160;Helsinki (HEL)&#38;#160;is the geographically closest place to transfer if coming in from East Asia.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Need to have a&#38;#160;cheap business class to Perth?&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Perth is the capital city of Western Australia and is the most isolated capital city of over 1,000,000 people in the world. It is in fact closer to Jakarta and Singapore than Adelaide (the nearest other Australian city).&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Perth sprawls along a flat coastal plain, centered along the Swan River and bounded by the Darling Scarp to the east and the Indian Ocean coastline in the west. Perth has a population of around 1.6 million (2009), making it the fourth largest city in Australia. The many uncrowded beaches along the Perth coastline define the lifestyle: Perth is laid-back, quiet and safe.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;All scheduled international and domestic flights arrive and depart from&#38;#160;Perth Airport&#38;#160;(IATA: PER). Though both international and domestic services operate under the same Perth Airport banner, the international terminal (Terminal 1) is in a completely separate area, about 10 km from the domestic terminals (Terminals 2 and 3).&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The domestic terminals are both connected as part of the same building, and it is just a short walk between them.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Airlines &#38;amp; Destinations&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Major airlines operating from each terminal:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Terminal 1 &#38;ndash; Perth International Airport: AirAsia, Qantas, Malaysia Airlines, Singapore Airlines, Thai Air, Tiger Airways Singapore, Virgin Australia and a few others.&#60;br /&#62;
    Terminal 2 &#38;ndash; Qantas Perth Domestic Airport: Qantas domestic flights QF400 and above, QantasLink (which services numerous regional centres in WA), Airnorth and Jetstar.&#60;br /&#62;
    Terminal 3 &#38;ndash; Skywest, Tiger Airways Australia and Virgin Australia Domestic terminal. Other airlines flying from here include Alliance and other regional airlines.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Major domestic airlines servicing Perth Airport are Qantas (full-service), Virgin Australia (full-service), Jetstar (low-cost, owned by Qantas and from Perth, only flies to a few cities), Tiger Airways (low-cost, only flies to a few cities), QantasLink (a regional subsidiary of Qantas) and Skywest (regional full-service, although does fly to Melbourne via Kalgoorlie).&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;International connections are mainly to Asian cities such as Singapore, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Dubai, Hong Kong and Guangzhou. From Africa, South African Airways operates a flight from Johannesburg.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;International Terminal 1&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The city and major hotels can be easily accessed by taxi or commercial shuttle buses from all terminals. Courtesy phones are located inside the terminals (for the domestic terminal, the courtesy phone is surrounded by a large board advertising accommodation past the baggage conveyor belt as you leave the arrivals area).&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;For more than two people it is often cheaper and faster to take a taxi into the city (waiting time and drop off other passengers can make a shuttle bus service to the city very long). A taxi by meter to the city will cost approximately $40 from the international airport; the shuttle costs about $16 per person.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;There is no public transport to the international terminal.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Domestic Terminals 2 &#38;amp; 3&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Transperth buses serve the domestic terminals. Useful services are:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Bus 37 runs from Kings Park via Perth city and connects with the Victoria Park Transfer Station and Belmont Forum Shopping Centre for connections with other Transperth bus/rail services. (every 30mins, 6:19AM-11:56PM, $3.60)&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;There are a couple of coffee shops and food outlets both before and after security, as well as basic shopping, books and souvenirs. If you have some time to kill in transfers, there are some cafes open during business hours in the surrounding industrial park. Walk straight across the carpark, or turn right and walk past the long term car park to the Flight Path Cafe in the Civil Aviation Authority building.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Terminal Transfers&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;A free transfer bus operates between T1 and T2/T3. The service runs every 50 minutes and the journey takes 10 minutes. During the night the service is still free but requires pre-booking by phone (0410 636 418).&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;A taxi between the terminals will still cost at least $20.&#60;br /&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Brisbane Business Class Special Offer&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Get the best Brisbane Business Class Special Offer!&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Brisbane is the capital of the state of Queensland. It has a population of about 2 million people, making it the third-largest city in Australia.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;It&#38;#8217;s a positive attitude and creative confidence that makes Brisbane a genuine new-world city. Even though Brisbane is rapidly developing and forward-thinking, it maintains a youthful enthusiasm and has what is arguably the most vibrant, laid back and friendliest atmosphere of any east-coast capital city.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Gaining international exposure during the 1982 Commonwealth Games, the 1988 World Expo and the 2001 Goodwill Games, Brisbane&#38;#8217;s year-round warm climate, spectacular scenery and pleasant locals has been the draw-card for many domestic and international visitors, making Brisbane the fastest-growing city in Australia.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;For many thousands of years Aboriginal people have lived in what is now known as Brisbane. In 1823, John Oxley was the first English colonist to explore Brisbane, which was then selected by the colony of New South Wales as the location for a new jail, intended to house dangerous prisoners in a remote location. The original settlement was established in what is now the suburb of Redcliffe but was later moved to a location further down the bay.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;In 1837, free settlers moved to the area and pushed to close the jail and to release the land in the area.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;In 1859, a gold rush led to the establishment of the colony of Queensland with Brisbane as its capital, named after Sir Thomas MakDougall Brisbane, the sixth Governor of New South Wales.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;In 1925, the Queensland State Parliament created the City of Brisbane Act, and set up a single government for the city of Brisbane.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Recent strong migration to Brisbane and the whole of south-east Queensland is taking place due to cheaper house prices, a pleasant climate, and good employment opportunities. The area is currently facing the challenge of providing enough fresh water for its residents. You&#38;#8217;re not likely to find the tap dry or see any visible signs of the shortage, but keep your showers relatively brief (local water restrictions call for 4 minute showers) and expect the locals to be horrified if you walk away from a running tap.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Brisbane is notorious for having been established on the floodplain of the Brisbane River, which has resulted in major floods in 1893, 1974 and 2011. The flood in January 2011 damaged various infrastructure along the river and surrounding suburbs, but most businesses and services have since recovered from this event.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Brisbane Airport (BNE)&#38;#160;is 20 km (12 mi) north-east of the city centre at Eagle Farm, north of the river.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;There are direct flights from all Australian capitals and numerous regional centres. Major carriers include Virgin Australia, Jetstar, and Qantas. The airport is serviced by many regional airlines and it is possible to fly daily to most Asian centres (and on to Europe), the United States and New Zealand, without flying via Sydney or Melbourne.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;There are International and Domestic terminals, but some domestic flights leave from the International Terminal and some international flights (via other Australian cities) leave from the Domestic Terminal. Check which terminal your flight uses and don&#38;#8217;t presume based on whether it is an international or domestic flight.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Transferring between terminals&#60;br /&#62;
    Allow sufficient time for the transfer between terminals. The terminals are 3km apart and it&#38;#8217;s not practical to walk with luggage between them; the main road that connects them has no pedestrian walkway and is very busy.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Tranfers between the airport terminals can be made on the&#38;#160;Airtrain&#38;#160;service. It offers connections during the day with a train every 15-30mins. The train fare is $5, $4.50 if you book a ticket online beforehand, and the trip is 2 mins long. The Airtrain fare is included by Virgin Australia and by Qantas when connecting between their flights; just present your boarding pass to the Airtrain station staff.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Domestic to International Transfers operate M-F 5:40AM-8PM, Sa Su 6AM-8PM.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;International to Domestic Transfers operate M-F 5:30AM-7:45PM, Sa Su 5:30AM-7:30PM.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Another option is the&#38;#160;TBus&#38;#160;service. Services operate every 20 minutes and bus stops are located outside the Qantas and Virgin Australia arrivals hall at the Domestic Terminal, and outside the arrivals hall at the International Terminal. All trips are $5, children under 4 are free. This bus also services Airport Village, which is close to the Direct Factory Outlet (DFO), a small shopping centre that specialises in clothing and homewares stores, but also contains a food court. It&#38;#8217;s expensive, but worth checking out if you&#38;#8217;ve got more than a few hours between flights. Be careful though, as the last bus back to the airport terminals is at 6:20PM.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Outside of Airtrain hours or if you have a limited connection time, a&#38;#160;taxi&#38;#160;is your only option.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;From the airport to the city&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Airtrain&#38;#160;connects to the city from the airport every fifteen minutes during peak times and stops at Central, South Bank, Fortitude Valley and Roma Street stations. An adult fare to the city stations is $15 and a return ticket is $28 and can be purchased at Airtrain stations. There is a 10% discount for purchasing online for one-way or return journeys, but only if you are starting at the airport. Travel time to the city stations can be up to 30 mins. Trains start running between 5AM-6AM. The last trains leave the city around 7PM and the airport about 8PM. It is possible to take the Airtrain direct to the Gold Coast, although it is necessary to connect to a bus service at Nerang Station to reach Surfers Paradise, or at Robina Station to reach Coolangatta.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;CoachTrans&#38;#160;also provides transfers via shuttle bus to Brisbane City accommodation and to the Gold Coast. Adult fare (one way) to Brisbane City is $14, and an Adult fare (one way) to the Gold Coast is $39. Fares are cheaper if you buy a return ticket.&#38;#160;You can end up waiting up to an hour&#38;#160;if you try to book when you arrive at the airport, so pre-booking is a must and no refunds are allowed. Travel time varies depending on the number of passengers on the bus and traffic; it could be anywhere from 20-60 minutes.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;A cheaper public transport alternative is to use the Brisbane Airport Courtesy Bus to DFO/Number 1 Airport Village, and transfer to the 308 bus (direction Chermside) to Toombul Interchange, where you can catch a train to the city. This costs under $3 with a go card, off peak; and under $5 for a single ticket.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;A taxi from the airport to Brisbane central costs approximately $35. A good option for getting into the City can therefore be for two or more travellers to share the cost of a taxi to Brisbane Central. Always ask a set price before agreeing to a taxi ride, however, and be sure to tell the driver how many people he/she is taking to avoid sudden price hikes with detail changes. It is additionally useful to find a local returning home to avoid drivers taking advantage of foreigners. Brisbane locals are invariably friendly and happy to skirt the system for convenience and cost savings. From Brisbane Central or Roma Street station a traveller can get to just about anywhere else in Brisbane.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Additionally, the airport also hosts all major car rental companies.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;From the Gold Coast&#60;br /&#62;
    Surfside buses regularly ply the route from Tweed Heads all the way along the Gold Coast, with connections to the train to Brisbane at Robina. You can buy a single ticket to cover the trip, costing around $17.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Gold Coast (OOL)&#38;#160;a.k.a.&#38;#160;Coolangatta Airport&#38;#160;is a low-cost carrier hub, serviced by AirAsia X, Jetstar, Pacific Blue and others. There is a Surfside shuttle bus from the terminal to the Gold Coast Hwy, which has regular services to Robina station. Again, a single ticket will cover the two hour journey.&#60;br /&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Sydney is the Harbor City. It is the largest, oldest and most cosmopolitan city in Australia with an enviable reputation as one of the world&#38;#8217;s most beautiful and liveable cities. Brimming with history, nature, culture, art, fashion, cuisine, design, it is set next to miles of ocean coastline and sandy surf beaches. The city is also home to the Sydney Opera House and the Sydney Harbor Bridge, two of the most iconic structures on the planet.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Sydney is a major global city and one of the most important cities for finance in the Asia-Pacific. Sydney hosted the first Olympics of the new millennium, and continues to attract and host large international events. The city is surrounded by nature and national parks, which extend into the suburbs and right to the shores of the harbor.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Sydney Kingsford Smith International Airport&#38;#160;(IATA:&#38;#160;SYD) is Australia&#38;#8217;s busiest airport and the main gateway to Australia. It is located 6 km from the City centre in Southern Sydney on the northern shores of Botany Bay. Sydney Airport is the oldest continually operated commercial airport anywhere in the world.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Over 35 airlines fly in and out of Sydney Airport with daily flights linking Sydney to key destinations on every continent. The Asian-Pacific transport hubs of Hong Kong, Singapore, Bangkok, Tokyo and Seoul have several daily flights, as do the European centres of London, Paris and Frankfurt (with stopovers in Asia or the Indian Ocean). There are also non-stop flights to Dubai in the Middle East. North America is connected via Los Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas-Fort Worth and Vancouver. Travellers from South America can fly direct from Buenos Aires or Santiago (stopover in Auckland).&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;You can fly to Sydney directly from all other Australian capital cities and from many major regional airports. Otherwise, you need to fly to the state capital and transfer to a Sydney flight. Sydney can be reached within an hour and a half from Melbourne and Brisbane, 45 minutes from Canberra and just under four hours from Perth and Alice Springs&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Airlines and terminals&#60;br /&#62;
    Check which terminal you are going to.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;International terminal (T1) handles all international flights and some domestic flights. Check your itinerary and flight number because connections, customs etc will take longer when arriving or departing from the International Terminal, even on a domestic flight. You do not need a passport when travelling domestically, just hang on to your boarding pass.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Domestic terminal 2 (T2) is the largest domestic terminal. Airlines using this terminal include Qantaslink (Qantas flights numbered 1600 and above), Aeropelican, Regional Express (Rex), Jetstar, Tiger and Virgin Australia.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Domestic terminal 3 (T3) handles Qantas domestic flights numbered from 400 to 1599, which are mostly services to larger cities and towns.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Facilities&#60;br /&#62;
    T1 (International terminal) has food and shopping both before and after immigration and security. There is an open air beer garden and bistro by check-in Bay A on the departure level. There are cafes on both departure and arrival levels. Good coffee and food can had for a reasonable price, but it is easy to buy poor overpriced coffee and food too. Departures has cheaper prices than downstairs at arrivals. There is a better and cheaper choice of food before going through security, at the large central food hall in departures. Avoid currency exchange offices (see the Currency exchange section). Two free showers for both males and females are available by check-in bay A on the departures level. There is also an open air observation deck, with the entrance next to check-in bay B on the departures level, through the bistro and up the elevator. A post office is in the check-in area, but it is only open during business hours. Post boxes are available after customs. There is a small kids play area after security. There is a large duty free shop selling alcohol, cigarettes, perfume and electronics available when departing and arriving. There are some free Internet terminals in departures, even a few before security. There are paid Internet terminals there too and downstairs in arrivals. Trolleys cost money landside of security. Pick one up airside where they are free, or out in the carpark where they have been left by previous users. Travel Concierge Sydney Airport offers those arriving into Sydney a booking service for shuttle bus tickets, accommodation, tours and attraction tickets, they offer best prices and can look after many of your tourist requirements. They are located in T1 Arrivals Hall in-between both arrival gates (AB &#38;amp; CD).&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;T2 has a large food and shopping area, with a large selection of food outlets located to the right after you go through security. There are also gift shops, bookshops and some clothing stores. There are nice views over the tarmac from the eating area. There are ATMs before and after security. Everyone is able to go through security, whether travelling or not. Travel Concierge Sydney Airport has a smaller desk in T2 opposite baggage carousel 3, where you can buy shuttle bus tickets, accommodation, tours and attraction tickets, they offer best prices and can look after many of your tourist requirements.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;T3 (Qantas domestic) has a food hall with a variety of food and coffee. Nice Thai is available for around $15 or Hungry Jacks for normal prices. The food hall is airside of security, but you do not need to be a passenger to pass through. Most food and drink places and the security checkpoint close 30 minutes or so before the last departure. Don&#38;#8217;t expect to be able to get anything at all if you are arriving on a late flight. Don&#38;#8217;t expect people to be able to get to the gate to meet you on a late arrival as they will have to wait at baggage claim if you arrive after the last departure. There are Wi-Fi and Internet terminals available for $5 per hour.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;For accommodation around the airport, see the Southern Sydney article. You can book all airport accommodation from Travel Concierge Sydney Airport located in T1 and T2.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Overnight&#60;br /&#62;
    Due to curfew laws, no planes arrive or depart between 11PM and 5:30AM. The domestic terminals (T2 and T3) close after the last flight has cleared (around 11PM) and reopen at 4AM &#38;ndash; you cannot remain in the terminal. T1 (international) also closes around 11PM and reopens at 4AM &#38;ndash; but there is small transit area with basic facilities that you can remain in if you are already in the terminal (landside). This is located on level 1 near the entrance to the train station. There are limited seats and it fills up quickly when security starts herding people out of the terminal. The last train service departs at 11:45PM.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Transfer between domestic terminals T2 and T3 must be done on foot. Follow the signs either via the railway station underground, or across the car park.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Transfer between T1 and T2/T3 is 4 km by road, as the terminals are on opposite sides of the airport tarmac. You will have to use one of the following methods to transfer:&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;Transfer between terminals&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;An&#38;#160;Air-side shuttle&#38;#160;is available free of charge if you are connecting through with Qantas or a One World partner airline. Passengers transferring Virgin Australia and a codeshare flight or other international Virgin Flight (Pacific Blue, Polynesian Blue, United Airlines, Virgin Atlantic Airways and Hawaiian Airlines) are entitled for a free pass on the T-bus (see below).&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;If you aren&#38;#8217;t entitled to a free shuttle, your best bet is to catch a&#38;#160;suburban train&#38;#160;($5.20). It is a 2 minute journey between Domestic and International stations with around 10 minute frequency. Follow the train signs from the terminal and board any train on platform 1 for International to Domestic transfers and any train on platform 2 for domestic to international. Travel&#38;#160;one stop&#38;#160;only, as the train continues to the city or into suburban Sydney.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;T-bus&#38;#160;($5.50) outside the terminal building. The T-bus is a dedicated terminal shuttle and uses the normal roads. It is scheduled to take around 10 minutes but can be stuck in Sydney traffic at peak times. Runs at a 10-20 minute frequency and you pay the driver on boarding. This method is slower and slightly more expensive than the train, but it stops close to the terminal and has plenty of room for baggage.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Sydney Buses&#38;#160;($3.50) T1 yellow bus stop outside the arrivals, or outside T3 at domestic. It is possible to use the ordinary city bus service to transfer between terminals with the same speed as the T-bus, albeit with less frequent departures and less luggage space. T1 to T2/T3 take the 400 towards Bondi Junction. T2/T3 to T1 take the 400 towards Burwood. There is only one stop for buses going both directions, and catching the bus going the wrong way will again send you off into suburban Sydney.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Taxi&#38;#160;($10). The trip will take around 10 minutes, though the wait for taxis can be very long. Drivers may also give you attitude as they have to line up for a long time and generally want bigger fares.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Walk. If you have little luggage and some time to kill, the walk will take around an hour. There is a footpath the whole way, and has good views of planes taking off metres above your head, and of the Alexandra Canal. From T1 walk across the car park, across the crossing, under the underpass, and follow the Airport Drive footpath/cycleway to the right, keeping the canal on your left, and airport on your right. From T2/T3 follow the road out of the airport, and turn left onto Qantas drive, and keep the airport on your left. The route is not covered.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Between the airport and the city&#60;br /&#62;
    Sydney Airport is 9 km from the city centre and reaching the city centre or other suburbs is easy, whether it be by suburban rail, bus or car. If you&#38;#8217;re going to the city centre the following methods are your best bet:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Suburban trains&#38;#160;operated by CityRail depart frequently from Domestic and International rail stations, which are connected to the airline terminals via lifts and pedestrian subways. A single ticket to the city is $15.40 from domestic or $16.20 from international, including an airport station surcharge (GatePass) of $11.80. If you have or buy a MyMulti ticket, you just need to pay the gatepass fee. The airport is located on the Airport &#38;amp; East Hills line and is served by a train every 10 minutes during off-peak, and every 7 minutes during peak. Passengers for the city centre should take a train from Platform 1. The trains are used by commuters during peak hours, and you may not get a seat.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Local buses. If you want to skip the GatePass fee, a good option is to take the 400 local bus route towards Bondi Junction. The stop after the domestic terminal is 200-300 m from the Mascot suburban rail station, which is one stop from the Domestic Terminal but free from the GatePass fee. The bus costs $3.30 and the train $3.20, and with a MyMulti card it costs no extra. The bus stops are located outside T1 and T3 (but not T2). There is only limited luggage space on the bus, but if you can manage backpacks or suitcases by yourself it should not be a problem.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Shuttle Bus&#38;#160;operators will drive a group of passengers to the city and deliver them to their hotels &#38;ndash; to buy a ticket on a shuttle bus to your hotel you need to purchase them from the information desks in T1, T2 and T3. In T1 and T2 you can buy shuttle bus tickets from the approved outlet called Travel Concierge Sydney Airport, prices are $16 one way and $28 return. In T3, it is called Traveller Services.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Taxis&#38;#160;to the city centre should cost approximately $30 (including tolls), and more to other Sydney destinations (The Rocks $35-40, North Sydney $35, Manly $50, Parramatta $80-100 etc.) You can expect to pay a $3.00 airport taxi levy and a $5.50 Eastern Distributor toll on top of the metered fare. If you are arriving on a Friday evening, you may face a long queue for taxis. Asking the driver to take O&#38;#8217;Riordan Street is a little slower but shorter and cheaper than the Eastern Distributor tollway which frequently experiences traffic congestion during peak times.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Vehicle rental&#38;#160;is available at all terminals from a variety of rental companies (see Sydney Airport website for current list).&#38;#160; After you rent a vehicle, you will be directed to pick it up at a parking space in the adjacent parking garage. You return the vehicle to the same area.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Having someone pick you up. At T1 (International), a private car can not stop legally at the arrivals area to pick up someone from the curb. If you exit the car park within 15 minutes, it is free, otherwise it is $7 per half hour. At T3 (domestic terminals), cars can stop at the pickup area only if there is someone already at the kerb. At T2, there is a pick up area inside the paid car park. Follow the yellow stenciled signs outside the terminal. Car park charges apply if you stay longer that 10 minutes. Fines apply for waiting at the arrivals areas or for picking up at the departures areas. Leaving your car is out of the question. The parking officers can photograph your car and licence plate and fine you without warning you to move along.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Walk and train from T1. T1 (the international terminal) is less than 2km from Wolli Creek Station, from where a train to the city costs $3.40 and a MyMulti can be used with no surcharge. The walk isn&#38;#8217;t signposted and may be very quiet after dark. It is all surfaced, has only one set of three steps (in the airport, near the customs building), and takes in some nice scenery by the Cooks River. Exit straight from the international terminal (T1), follow the pedestrian path under the multistory car park, and continue just to the left of the customs building to the pedestrian crossing. Go under the road, as indicated by a greenMarsh Street&#38;#160;sign until, you run into a green fence with the canal directly in front of you. Follow the path up to your right around and back over the path you just walked on up to the Marsh Street bridge. Cross the Cooks River on the footpath on the right of Marsh St and then proceed along the cycleway next to the Cooks River (signposted to Tempe), keeping the river on your right. When you reach the Princes Hwy (6 lane road), cross at the pedestrian crossing lights, and continue straight on, past the apartment blocks, shops, to the end of the road, then turn right up to Wolli Creek Station. The walk will take about 20 minutes and will save you $12 (gatepass fee) on the train fare. Trains from Wolli Creek are even more frequent than from the airport since East Suburbs &#38;amp; Illawarra line trains also stop there.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Walk and train from T2 &#38;amp; T3. The Domestic terminals (T2 and T3) are about 1.7km from Mascot train station. The walk along suburban pavements takes about 20 minutes. Follow the road out of the domestic terminal and on to O&#38;#8217;Riordan Street. Follow O&#38;#8217;Riordan Street and then veer left onto Bourke Street. Cross Coward Street and then John Street, Mascot train station is on your right. An adult fare to the city (Central) from Mascot is $3.40 and a MyMulti card can be used with no surcharge.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;p&#62;Best Discounted Business Classes Flights to Bangkok&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Bangkok (Thai: กรุงเทพฯ Krung Thep) is the capital of Thailand and, with a population of over eleven million inhabitants, by far its largest city. Its high-rise buildings, heavy traffic congestion, intense heat and naughty nightlife do not immediately give you a warm welcome &#38;mdash; but don&#38;#8217;t let your first impression mislead you. It is one of Asia&#38;#8217;s most cosmopolitan cities with magnificent temples and palaces, authentic canals, busy markets and a vibrant nightlife that has something for everyone.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;For years, it was only a small trading post at the banks of the Chao Phraya River, until King Rama I, the first monarch of the present Chakri dynasty, turned it into the capital of Siam in 1782, after the burning of Ayutthaya by Burmese invaders. Since then, Bangkok has turned into a national treasure house and functions as Thailand&#38;#8217;s spiritual, cultural, political, commercial, educational and diplomatic centre.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Just under 14 degrees north of the Equator, Bangkok is a tropical metropolis that is also one of the most traveller-friendly cities in Asia. A furious assault on the senses, visitors are immediately confronted by the heat, the pollution and the irrepressible smile that accompanies many Thais. Despite the sensationalised international news reports and first impressions, the city is surprisingly safe (except from some petty crimes) and more organised than it initially appears, and full of hidden gems waiting to be discovered. The high relative humidity and warm temperature favour the growth of tropical plants &#38;mdash; you&#38;#8217;ll find exotic orchids and delicious fruit everywhere. Bougainvillea and frangipani bloom practically all over the city. Thai cuisine is justifiably famous, varied, and affordable. Bangkok for many represents the quintessential Asian capital. Saffron-robed monks, garish neon signs, graceful Thai architecture, spicy dishes, colourful markets, traffic jams and the tropical climate come together in a happy coincidence. It is difficult to leave with lukewarm impressions of the city.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Bangkok is served by two airports:&#38;#160;Suvarnabhumi Airport&#38;#160;and&#38;#160;Don Muang Airport. Suvarnabhumi Airport is used by all airlines in Thailand, except for domestic flights on Nok Air and Orient Thai, which still use the old Don Muang Airport. Due to the flooding of Don Muang Airport end of 2011, Orient Thai and Nokair both currently fly from Suvarnabhumi. Both these airports are about 30 km (19 mi) from the city centre, so be prepared for a long ride to get into the city. Also allow at least three hours to connect between them, as they are far away from each other and there is heavy congestion on the roads.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Suvarnabhumi Airport&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Located 30 km (19 mi) to the east of Bangkok, space-age Suvarnabhumi Airport (สุวรรณภูมิ, pronounced &#38;#8220;soo-wanna-poom&#38;#8221;) (IATA: BKK) started operations in September 2006 and is now Bangkok&#38;#8217;s main airport and the busiest airport in Southeast Asia. It is used for almost all international and domestic flights to Bangkok. There is only one terminal building, which covers both domestic and international flights, but it is huge (by some measures the world&#38;#8217;s largest), so allow time for getting around. There are two immigration sections, but processing time is lengthy &#38;mdash; at least 30 minutes.&#60;br /&#62;
    [edit] Facilities&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Suvarnabhumi offers all facilities you would expect from a major international airport. There&#38;#8217;s a transit hotel, ATMs, money exchange, restaurants, tax-free shops, an observation lounge and even a &#38;#8220;redemption booth&#38;#8221;, very reassuring for karmically challenged passengers. There are about 50 dining venues spread over the terminal building. The one that sounds most interesting probably is Panda Ready To Eat, but the cheapest place for a meal is Magic Food Point on level 1, near gate 8. There are a few stores in the check-in area, including a convenience store and a post office; however, the real shopping experience awaits travelers on the other side of immigration in the departure area, where the number of shops and duty free outlets leaves you wondering whether you are in an airport or a mall. There is not much to see at the observation deck on the seventh floor, since the steel structure of the roof blocks most of the view.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;There are plenty of ways to get into the city from Suvarnabhumi Airport. Most people opt for the Airport Rail Link, by far the fastest way to get into downtown, although taxis are also reasonably priced by world standards.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Located on the basement level of the passenger terminal, the Airport Rail Link offers a high-speed train service to downtown Bangkok. It&#38;#8217;s also a way of avoiding Bangkok&#38;#8217;s horrendous rush hour traffic, particularly when it&#38;#8217;s raining. Trains run 06:00-midnight every day and travel at an amazing 160 km/h (100 mi/h). Two different services are operated:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The non-stop Express Line brings you directly to either Makkasan or Phaya Thai station in 15/18 minutes for 90 baht one way, with plenty of space for luggage. Express trains leave Suvarnabhumi Airport every 20-30 minutes, but check the destination: Phaya Thai offers an easy transfer to the Skytrain, while Makkasan station is technically at walking distance of Phetchaburi MRT station, although the link bridge is still under construction and it&#38;#8217;s quite a hike at the moment (300+ m). You can take bus 556 here that heads directly for the Southern Bus Terminal (the bus stop is not clearly marked though). On the way back, Thai Airways offers baggage check-in at Makkasan if you arrive 3-13 hours before your flight.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The slightly slower City Line is a commuter rail line that stops at all stations. Trains leave every 15 minutes, and after Makkasan station it continues to Ratchaprarop and Phaya Thai stations. The ride to Phaya Thai takes 24 minutes from/to the airport and costs 15-45 baht depending on the number of stops. Given the fact that it runs more frequently, the City Line may effectively bring you to your destination sooner than the much more expensive Express Line.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;If you&#38;#8217;re heading downtown, the Airport Rail Link has a good connection to the BTS Skytrain at Phaya Thai, though you will have to buy a new ticket. If Khao San Road is your final destination, you can hail taxis from the main road (around 70 baht), or hop aboard bus 15 (7 baht); this bus goes along Ratchadamnoen Klang Road and Chakrabongse Road serving both sides of Khao San Road.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Private Airport Express buses, including backpacker favourite AE2 to Khao San Road, stopped running in June 2011. To take a public bus or minibus, you must first take the free shuttle bus ride from outside the second floor to the bus terminal that is a few kilometres away. Go to the first floor and walk to the far right of the terminal. Exit the last door, and continue about 100 m to the right, where you will see the sign for the &#38;#8220;ordinary bus&#38;#8221;. These free shuttle buses are white in colour, and will make a few other stops on the way to the terminal. The BMTA public bus lines are:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;549: Suvarnabhumi to Min Buri&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;550: Suvarnabhumi to Bang Kapi&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;551: Suvarnabhumi to Victory Monument&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;552: Suvarnabhumi to On Nut&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;552A: Suvarnabhumi to Sam Rong&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;553: Suvarnabhumi to Samut Prakan&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;554: Suvarnabhumi to Don Muang Airport&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;555: Suvarnabhumi to Rangsit (using the expressway)&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;558: Suvarnabhumi to Central Rama 2&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;559: Suvarnabhumi to Future Park Rangsit (using the outer ring road)&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;These services take about 1-2 hours depending on traffic; frequency is usually every 20 minutes during daytime. At nighttime, it ranges from 20 min-1 hr depending on the route. To give an example, the fare between Suvarnabhumi Airport and On Nut on 552 is 32 baht, and the journey takes about 40 minutes in mid-afternoon traffic. There are also privately-owned BMTA minibuses to many parts of Greater Bangkok, such as Don Muang Airport, Bang Kapi, Rangsit and Samut Prakan. They charge a flat rate of 50 baht and go directly to the destination, so they are faster than public buses that stop frequently along the way.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Long-distance first class bus services connect Suvarnabhumi Airport directly with Chachoengsao, Nong Khai, Pattaya, Rayong, and Trat.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Ordinary metered taxis are available on the first floor (one floor below arrivals). Follow the &#38;#8220;public taxi&#38;#8221; signs that lead to the outside of the airport premises, queue up and state your destination at the desk (English is understood). You&#38;#8217;ll get a two-part slip with your destination written in Thai on it. The small part is for your driver, the large part is for you. This ticket is for complaints and is how the system is enforced: hold on to it to help avoid arguments later. There is a 50 baht surcharge on top of the meter (not per passenger!), meaning that trips to the city will cost 250-400 baht (plus possible expressway tolls of 45 and 25 baht, depending on time). Make sure you have change ready to pass to the toll operators to avoid being overcharged for the tolls later on. The ride takes about 45-60 minutes depending on traffic and location. No other surcharges apply, not even for going back to the airport. If there is a huge taxi queue, consider taking a limousine taxi, or take the free shuttle bus to the Public Transport Center, which has more taxis. Go straight to the &#38;#8220;official taxi stand&#38;#8221; and wait there. It is rare, but there have been reports of rigged meters that make the ride cost more than 400 baht. These taxis usually appear highly modified and it is a good idea to avoid them, or record the licence plate number of the taxi.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;So-called limousine taxis (which charge by distance, e.g. around 800 baht to Sukhumvit) can be reserved at the limousine hire counter on the second floor (just outside arrivals), and aggressive touts will try to entice you on board. If you allow yourself to be waylaid by one of these taxi touts, they might quote you more than double the fare than an ordinary metered taxi would charge (900 baht instead of 400 baht, for example). You&#38;#8217;d be silly even acknowledging their existence &#38;mdash; ignore and walk straight past them.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;There are plenty of hotels near Suvarnabhumi Airport, and huge construction projects are planned for the future. Day room facilities for transit passengers are now available at the Miracle Grand Louis Tavern on floor 4, concourse G, ☎ +66 2 134-6565, 2,000 baht per 4-hour block, no reservations accepted. Travellers looking for a free quiet place to doze undisturbed at night can use one of the benches on the bottom floor of the terminal (which seem to be a popular choice with tourists and locals).&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;All other accommodation in Bangkok is listed in the relevant district articles. If you want an overnight stay within 20 min of the airport, get a hotel along Lat Krabang Road, here covered in the Ramkhamhaeng district. The Tourist Authority of Thailand and other hotel and tourist agencies have counters on the arrivals floor of the main terminal. You can make reservations at plenty of hotels here. Check for special promotions and also whether the hotel offers an airport pick-up and drop-off service &#38;mdash; especially useful for late night arrivals and early morning departures.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Don Muang Airport&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Don Muang Airport (IATA: DMK) (or Don Mueang), about 30 km (19 mi) north of downtown, was Bangkok&#38;#8217;s main airport until 2006. The airport currently handles Nok Air and Orient Thai domestic flights, but the former international terminal is now limited to charters and general aviation.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The public taxi stand is on the pavement outside the arrivals area (don&#38;#8217;t be fooled by all the taxi service booths in the main hall), and is probably your best bet for getting into town &#38;mdash; it&#38;#8217;s your only option after 23:00. The same booth and slip system as at Suvarnabhumi Airport is used here. If the queue at the taxi stand is long or you need a more spacious car, you may want to book a (so-called) limousine taxi from the desks in the terminal. This will get you a slightly nicer car at about twice the price (500-600 baht). Ignore any touts outside and do not get into any car with white licence plates, as these are not licenced to carry passengers.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Across a covered overpass from the airport is Don Muang Train Station. Tickets to Hualamphong Train Station in central Bangkok cost 5 baht at the ticket booth. While taking the train is the cheapest way to get from the airport to Bangkok, it is not for the faint-of-heart: schedules are erratic, the run-down passenger cars often have beggars roaming through them, and are relatively empty late at night.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;There are also a number of public transport buses going by the airport, just follow the signs out toward the train station. Buses towards central Bangkok are at the airport&#38;#8217;s side of the road, so don&#38;#8217;t cross the highway. These are useful bus lines:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Air-conditioned bus 504 will take you to CentralWorld at Ratchaprasong intersection (close to Siam Square), as well as to Lumphini Park and Silom, from where you can have access to the Skytrain.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Ordinary and air-conditioned bus 29 will take you to Hualamphong Train Station passing by many places, including Victory Monument and Siam Square. You can also get off at the Chatuchak Weekend Market, where you can switch onto the metro or Skytrain.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Air-conditioned bus 59 will take you to Sanam Luang in Rattanakosin. This route is time-consuming as Rattanakosin is far off from the airport.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Keep in mind that some of these buses don&#38;#8217;t complete the route. They are called &#38;#8220;additional bus&#38;#8221; (Thai: รถเสริม rot serm). These kind of buses have a red sign in front of them with the final destination written on it (in Thai script of course). Check this before taking the bus. You can ask the locals at the bus stop or a conductor on the bus.&#60;br /&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Seoul&#38;#160;(서울) is the capital of South Korea. With a population of over 10.5 million, Seoul is by far South Korea&#38;#8217;s largest city and one of East Asia&#38;#8217;s financial and cultural epicenters.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;With over 10 million people, a figure that doubles if you include neighboring cities and suburbs, Seoul is the largest city in South Korea and unquestionably the economic, political and cultural hub of the country. By some measures it is the second largest urban agglomeration on the planet, after Greater Tokyo. Situated between Shanghai and Tokyo and bordered by the impenetrable Democratic People&#38;#8217;s Republic of Korea to the north, the South Korean capital is sometimes overlooked by travelers. However, Seoul is an exciting location in its own right, not to mention cheaper than its rivals and incredibly safe. With beautiful palaces, great food and a shopping nightlife, Seoul is a frenetic way to experience the Asia of old and new.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Historically there is evidence for settlement in this area as far as 18 BC but Seoul as the capital city of South Korea has a history back to the 14th century. Originally named Hanseong (한성; 漢城), the city was the capital of the Joseon Dynasty from 1392 to 1910, when Korea was occupied by the Japanese. The Joseon Dynasty built most of Seoul&#38;#8217;s most recognisable landmarks, including the Five Grand Palaces and Namdaemun. After the Japanese surrender in 1945, the city was re-named to its current name, Seoul. Since the establishment of the Republic of Korea in 1948, Seoul has been the capital of South Korea. Occupied twice during the Korean War by Communist forces, the city was extensively rebuilt and today is one of Asia&#38;#8217;s primary metropolises. Much of Seoul&#38;#8217;s infrastructure and facilities, such as the buildings, stadiums, and transport systems, are exceptionally modern and clean.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Incheon Airport&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Most visitors arrive via Incheon International Airport (IATA: ICN), located on Yeongjong Island in the neighboring city of Incheon and covered in detail in its own article.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The A&#38;#8217;REX train link connects the airport to Seoul Station (for further connections to KTX high-speed services) and Gimpo Airport (most domestic flights), operating from 5:20 AM until midnight. Two versions exist: Express services to the city (every half hour) takes 43 minutes and cost ₩13,300 (with WiFi available on board), while commuter services (every 6 minutes) take 53 minutes and cost ₩3,700.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Travel time to Gimpo Airport is 28/35 minutes, with both services charging ₩3100, making this the fastest and cheap option for intra-airport transfer as well. If you are heading to Incheon International from Seoul Station and using Korean, Asiana or Jeju Air, the express train may be your best option. You can check your bags and even pass through security and immigration, allowing you to skip the lines at the airport and to spend a little longer in the city, or helping you make a mad dash to the airport.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;However, if you have a lot of luggage or are heading to southern parts of Seoul (eg. Gangnam), the airport buses remain your best option. Limousine buses [6] (₩15,000 to/from city for one way, ₩6500 to/from Gimpo Airport (domestic flight)) travel directly to major areas and big hotels in Seoul, while public buses (₩8,000-9.000) will take you to major transit hubs. If you&#38;#8217;re visiting for the first time, it&#38;#8217;s worth paying a bit extra for the limousine bus. For either bus type, consult the big maps or staff to figure out which route best suits your needs; you can then find the shuttles outside 1st floor arrivals (if possible get this information from your hotel before arriving). Or simply, walk out and ask the many ticket sellers (they are wearing vests) which bus goes to your hotel because if it&#38;#8217;s a popular one or in a popular area, they&#38;#8217;ll surely know which you&#38;#8217;ll need. It&#38;#8217;s best to buy tickets at any of the the ticket gates near the bus arrival area but you can also pay the fare using won or a T-Money card if you have one. The limousine bus drivers are extremely friendly but don&#38;#8217;t count on them knowing too much English. There are maps inside the buses letting passengers know which stops are upcoming and these are also announced in Korean and English. Pressing any of the red buttons inside signals to the driver you want off at the next stop.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;You can purchase and recharge a T-Money card at the GS25 store which is located at the end of the arrivals area, next to &#38;#8220;International Arrivals F&#38;#8221; exit.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;If you have a late flight and plan on getting into Seoul via bus, make sure you get out to the curb as soon as you can. The last buses run shortly after the last flights land. If you miss your bus, you&#38;#8217;ll be stuck paying for a taxi, as the trains will stop running too.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;A taxi direct to Seoul will run around ₩50,000/70,000 regular/deluxe. Black deluxe taxis (모범 택시) and almost all regular taxis accept credit cards, but a few regular taxis (일반 택시) may not. Ask the driver before you get on if you can pay by credit card. You are expected to pay any road tolls on top of the meter fare. Having your destination written down in Korean will be very helpful. Steer clear of taxi drivers trying to pick you up from inside the terminal and even the bus stop. As both buses and taxis are subject to traffic, allow extra time for rush hour delays (or take the train back).&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Gimpo Airport&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The closer but older Gimpo Airport (김포국제공항, GMP) caters only to the shuttle services to Tokyo-Haneda, Osaka-Kansai and Shanghai-Hongqiao, as well as domestic flights within South Korea.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Gimpo Airport is easily reached on the A&#38;#8217;REX link from Seoul Station or Incheon Airport, as well as subway lines 5 and 9. All lines intersect Line 2 which runs in a large circle through Seoul. Line 9(Gold Line), the first privately run subway line in Seoul, has three express trains per hour. Travelers coming into Seoul should first have detailed directions to their destination from the nearest station then consult the subway map before deciding on which line and route to take. All three lines cost ₩1,000-2,100 (depending on distance), while a taxi to central Seoul will run around ₩30,000. Discounts for subway fare are available with T-Money cards.&#60;br /&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Hong Kong (香港 Heūng g&#38;oacute;ng in Cantonese, meaning fragrant harbour) is a place with multiple personalities, as a result of being both Cantonese Chinese and under a more recent contemporary ex-British influence. Today, the former British colony is a major tourism destination for China&#38;#8217;s increasingly affluent mainland population. It is also an important hub in East Asia with global connections to many of the world&#38;#8217;s cities. It is a unique destination that has absorbed people and cultural influences from places as diverse as Vietnam and Vancouver and proudly proclaims itself to be Asia&#38;#8217;s World City.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the People&#38;#8217;s Republic of China is much more than a harbour city. The traveller weary of its crowded streets may be tempted to describe it as Hong Kongcrete. Yet, this territory with its cloudy mountains and rocky islands is mostly a rural landscape. Much of the countryside is classified as Country Park and, although 7 million people are never far away, it is possible to find pockets of wilderness that will reward the more intrepid tourist.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Hong Kong has a subtropical climate with at least one season to match your comfort zone. Boasting one of the world&#38;#8217;s best airports, it is the ideal stopover for those who wish to travel deeper into the Orient.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;While legally part of China, Hong Kong is secluded from mainland China as a dependency with a high degree of autonomy. Within the PRC, the former colony has its own constitution which lays out its own laws, separate immigration controls, financial system and is officially bi-lingual (Cantonese and English). It also enjoys western-style freedoms unheard of on the Chinese mainland. The democratic system and ideals of a free and open society are firmly rooted here.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Hong Kong International Airport&#60;br /&#62;
    Hong Kong International Airport (IATA: HKG) which is also known as Chek Lap Kok 赤鱲角 (named after the small island it was built over), is the main port for visitors to Hong Kong by air. Designed by Sir Norman Foster, this modern and efficient building opened in July 1998 and has since been named &#38;#8220;World&#38;#8217;s Best Airport&#38;#8221; by Skytrax in annual ratings five times.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Passengers on all arriving international flights (even to immediately take a connecting international flight) must go through an additional security &#38;#8220;gate&#38;#8221; check shortly after deplaning. Similar to U.S. and European personal security checks, this &#38;#8220;gate&#38;#8221; check will however confiscate any sharp objects regardless of size or purpose. Through-checked baggage also often receive additional scanning.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;There are many direct flights to Hong Kong from every continent in the world. Most major cities in Oceania, Europe and North America are all served with at least one daily flight, and flights between Hong Kong and other major Asian cities are also frequent. Cathay Pacific operates one of the longest air routes in the world, linking Hong Kong and New York (JFK).&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Pakistan International Airlines has flights from all major cities of Pakistan to and from Hong Kong. For destinations within China, it is often cheaper to fly from Shenzhen than from Hong Kong, as flights between the mainland and Hong Kong are considered to be international flights and priced accordingly. There are also flights between Hong Kong and several mid-Pacific islands and nations.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Cathay Pacific and its subsidiary airline Dragonair are Hong Kong&#38;#8217;s main carriers, with Hong Kong Airlines and Hong Kong Express providing some welcome competition.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;There are two terminals, creatively called T1 and T2. Signs on approach to the airport by car/taxi list the terminals and check-in zones. Once checked-in, you can clear security at either terminal with an underground shuttle bus outside the security area. There are more shopping opportunities before security at T2, but its shops close earlier. There are lots of shopping opportunities after security as well. Travelers will find an efficient post office in the airport, providing boxes, wrapping material, scissors and tape. It might be more economical to send your excess luggage via surface mail than paying fees to the airline. Terminal 2 is a check-in only facility, all flights depart from Terminal 1.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;There is a manned left luggage facility in the arrival hall, perfect for securely storing your luggage at the airport, for around $55-$80 per day (depending on duration): it opens from 6:00AM to 1:00AM.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Overall, services at Chek Lap Kok are generally far better, or at least on par, with those at other major international airports.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The Airport Express train is the quickest and most comfortable passenger transport from the airport to central Hong Kong, also stopping at Tsing Yi and Kowloon en route. As the only rail link to the airport, it has a frequency of a train every 12 minutes and takes 24 minutes to Hong Kong station. All stations have staff to help you get heavy bags on and off of the train; there is no need to tip them. Each way costs $60-$100, and a round trip $110-$180, depending on the distance traveled. A fare saver is thus to take the Airport Express to Tsing Yi, the first stop, and change to the parallel but stopping Tung Chung underground line, which costs in total $71.8 one-way or $133.6 return as opposed to $100 one-way and $180 return.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;If you buy your ticket from a machine you will have to pay the standard fare, however, if you travel with other people you can get a discount from the staff at the counter. If in doubt, ask the staff for advice before you hand over your money. After reaching your station, you can continue to your final destination by underground (MTR) or taxi.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;If you wish for a leisurely scenic ride from the airport, you should consider taking a bus. There are two companies which run the airport buses to the city, Citybus (&#38;lsquo;CityFlyer&#38;#8217;) and Long Win. They will offer lush views of Lantau Island and traverse over the Tsing Ma Bridge, the seventh longest suspension bridge in the world.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Some of the buses are WebBus, you can use you mobile device to go on the internet.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The &#38;#8220;A&#38;#8221; airport buses is mostly designed for flight passengers / tourists etc and depends on where you are going they might be easier to use than the airport express, they are cheaper than airport express train (average fare HKD $40). The &#38;#8220;E&#38;#8221; airport buses is mostly designed for airport workers, however they do have luggage racks, they are cheaper than the &#38;#8220;A&#38;#8221; buses (average fare HKD $20), however they take longer because they go through various cargo terminal, and airline offices on-route.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;A good option to central Hong Kong is to take bus S1 from the airport to the Tung Chung MTR station ($3.50) and change to the Tung Chung underground line for a cheaper ride to the city (Kowloon $11.4, Hong Kong $18.8). This is even cheaper than changing from the Airport Express at Tsing Yi. For a full listing of buses available at HKIA refer to the Hong Kong airport website. There is also an information board at the bus terminal.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;A taxi from the airport to Central will cost you around $350 depending on your exact destination. Use a red taxi for destinations to Hong Kong Island and Kowloon, Green taxis are restricted to the New Territories and blue taxis are for Lantau Island.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Theofficial taxi fare table is available online. There is a large chart at the exit to the taxi stand showing the approximate fares to most destinations. The law is strict on taxi drivers who must charge according to the meter. According to the Hong Kong Transport Department, the first two kilometers costs $20, then $1.50 for each 200 meters. When the meter fare reaches $72.5, the cost for each 200 meters will change to $1.00 The meter fare does not include the luggage fee, toll fee, waiting fee or pet fee.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Taxis from the airport to downtown Kowloon can suffer from traffic congestion. If you are going to Hong Kong Island, tell the taxi driver to use the &#38;#8220;Western Harbour Crossing&#38;#8221; to avoid congestion, but this will attract an additional surcharge.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;From the airport there are private cars and vans operating illegally as taxis. Do not take these as they are not licensed and in case of accidents, your insurance will not cover you.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;If departing Hong Kong by air, you can check-in your luggage and get boarding passes at Hong Kong and Kowloon MTR stations. They stations serve as airport satellite locations with airline staff and ticketing booths. This is convenient for people wishing to spend precious final hours in the city instead of at remote Lantau Island where the airport is located.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;If you opt for these check-in services, you must first pay the fare for riding Airport Express. With some airlines, such as Cathay Pacific, you can drop off your luggage up to one day before travel, get your boarding passes, go off on that last shopping foray, and then return to ride Airport Express to complete your Hong Kong adventure.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Usually there are some sort of Airport Express discounts offers, check the MTR Airport Express website for most up-to-date discounts.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Shenzhen International Airport&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Because flying from Hong Kong to the mainland is considered an international flight, flying around mainland China using Shenzhen Airport (IATA: SZX) is often significantly cheaper. Also the connections to Hong Kong are good, albeit time-consuming: first you take the underground (Shenzhen Metro) line 1 from the airport to the Luohu terminus (65 minutes, costs 8.55 yuan or $8), then pass through a long corridor and an international border gate (make sure to have your visa ready for this) and once in Hong Kong, hop on the East Rail suburban rail line to Hung Hom (43 minutes, costs $31.8). Total travel time from Shenzhen airport to Hong Kong is thus under two hours and the price $39.8.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Alternatively, from the Elements shopping center above the Kowloon MTR station on the Tung Chung and the Airport Express line, there is a shop front waiting room where you can check-in and receive your boarding pass (although check in at this location is not available for China Southern Airlines passengers), and then board a bus direct to Shenzhen airport. This in-town check-in is completely separate from the in-town check-in provided for Hong Kong International Airport. Take the escalators up from the AE/MTR station to 1/F of the Elements Mall, turn right, and then it is opposite Starbucks. The bus uses the new western passage immigration facilities where both Hong Kong SAR and Chinese immigration formalities are completed under one roof. The cost of the service is $100 and the bus is advertised to take 75 minutes, but is more like 100 minutes in reality. Buses currently run every half an hour from 6:30AM to 7PM at Hong Kong side, and from 10AM to 9PM at Shenzhen side.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Macau International Airport&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Because of higher fees at Hong Kong International Airport, it is often cheaper to fly out of Macau International Airport (IATA: MFM). Air Asia has set up a hub at Macau and flies to destinations such as Beijing and Bangkok among others. Macau International Airport is easily reached by ferry from Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and Hong Kong International Airport. With the Express Link service, you can even transfer directly from airport to ferry (or vice versa) without going through Macau immigration.&#60;br /&#62;

Business Class travel deals.</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;p&#62;Need the lowest possible price to Frankfurt?&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Frankfurt is the business and financial center of Germany and the largest city in the German state of Hesse. The city is known for its futuristic skyline and the biggest German airport.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Located on the river Main, Frankfurt is the financial capital of Continental Europe and the transportation center of Germany. Frankfurt is home of the European Central Bank and the German Stock Exchange. Furthermore, it hosts some of the world&#38;#8217;s most important trade shows, such as the Frankfurt Auto Show and the Frankfurt Book Fair.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Frankfurt is a city of contrasts. Wealthy bankers, students and granola drop-outs coexist in a city that has some of the highest, most avant-garde skyscrapers of Europe next to well maintained old buildings. The downtown area, especially R&#38;ouml;mer square and the museums at the River Main, draw millions of tourists every year. On the other hand, many off the beaten track neighborhoods, such as Bockenheim, Bornheim, Nordend and Sachsenhausen, with their intact beautiful 19th century streets and parks are often overlooked by visitors.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Frankfurt is the place where Germany&#38;#8217;s major autobahns and railways intersect. About 650,000 people commute to the city each day, not counting the 660,000 people who really live here. With a huge airport &#38;mdash; the third-largest in Europe &#38;mdash; it is the gateway to Germany and for many people also the first point of arrival in Europe. Further, it is a prime hub for interconnections within Europe and for intercontinental flights.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Frankfurt has the highest percentage of immigrants in Germany: about 25% of Frankfurt&#38;#8217;s 660,000 people have no German passport and another 10% are naturalized German citizens. With about 35% immigrants, Frankfurt is the most diverse of German cities.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Frankfurt is home to many museums, theaters and a world-class opera.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Frankfurt Airport (IATA: FRA) is among the busiest in Europe &#38;mdash; third in passenger traffic after London Heathrow and Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport &#38;mdash; and the ninth busiest airport in the world. Frankfurt is the banking center of Germany and hosts numerous international trade fairs. Therefore all major airlines and all airline alliances fly frequently to Frankfurt and connects it to every continent and major city in the world. The German flagcarrier Lufthansa is the main airline in Frankfurt and offers the best connections.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The airport has two terminals (A third is scheduled to be opened in 2015). Terminal 1 is the home of Lufthansa and the Star Alliance airlines. Terminal 2 is for all other airlines. Terminal 1 is separated into Concourses A, B and C. Terminal 1 is a multi-level maze with poor signage &#38;amp; changing entrances due to ongoing construction work and insufficient capacity. Lufthansa tries to ease the confusion, therefore Business Class passengers (+ Gold &#38;amp; Silver Star Alliance Card Holders) have a designated check in area in Terminal 1 A. First class passengers of Lufthansa &#38;amp; Swiss Int&#38;#8217;l Airlines (+ LH HON Circle card holders) are allowed to check-in in the separate First Class terminal on the right side of Terminal 1, which has its own driveway. All Star Alliance economy class travelers and other Star Alliance partners are checked in in Terminal 1B &#38;amp; 1C. The terminals are connected by the Sky Train (both landside and airside).&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The departure gates have some of the most innovative seating around, with bench seats facing many directions and cafe-style tables and chairs for those who wish to whip out their laptops (sans coffee, alas). Passengers requiring special assistance should be advised that they might have to descend several flights of stairs to get to a bus that takes them to the plane, rather than disability-friendly ramps, so talk to the gate agent early if stairs are a problem.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;Terminal 1 has public showers for &#38;euro;6 (includes towel, foot mat, shower gel, and hair dryer). One location is in the B Departures area, in the Shopping Boulevard, across from &#38;#8220;TUMI&#38;#8221;. The other is in the secure area of B Concourse (good for transit passengers), Level 2, near gate B 30 and the duty free shopping. There is luggage storage in both terminals for &#38;euro;5 per bag per day.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The airport has a long visitor terrace on top of terminal 2 (adults &#38;euro;4). It also offers 45-minute airside bus tours (adults &#38;euro;6, hourly from 11 (holidays) or 1-4PM, ticket booth is at the bridge between terminal 1 and &#38;#8220;Frankfurt Airport Centre&#38;#8221;, follow signs and information for Flughafen Erlebnisfahrten (&#38;#8220;Airport Experience Tour&#38;#8221;).&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The airport is connected to downtown Frankfurt by taxi, bus (Line 61 to Frankfurt S&#38;uuml;dbahnhof (Frankfurt South Station), and most easily by S-Bahn (fast commuter trains). To get to the city, take lines S8 or S9 in the direction of Offenbach Ost or Hanau at the Regionalbahnhof (regional train station) in Terminal 1 (entrances in section A and B): interactive route planner. The lines S1-6/8/9 travel through the cornerstone of the system, an underground tunnel (the Citytunnel) through central Frankfurt. If you want to change to long-distance trains get off at Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof(Frankfurt Central Station) or Frankfurt S&#38;uuml;dbahnhof (Frankfurt South Station). If you want to go downtown, get off at Frankfurt Taunusanlage, Frankfurt Hauptwache or Frankfurt Konstablerwache, which are in the heart of the city. The ride from the airport to the central station takes 14 minutes. Be sure to purchase a ticket at the vending machines in the train station before boarding the train.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;If you want to go to the airport via S-Bahn, take the S8 or S9 in the direction of Wiesbaden. Don&#38;#8217;t take the S1 &#38;mdash; while it has the same general direction and leaves the central station at the same platform, it will go along the wrong side of the river Main. The line S1 does not stop at the airport.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The Frankfurt airport also has connections for inter-city trains. Regional trains to Mainz, Wiesbaden, and Hanau stop at the same place as the S-Bahn to Frankfurt. Connections outside the Frankfurt region have a separate train station, the Fernbahnhof (&#38;#8220;long-distance train station&#38;#8221;). Here, you can board high-speed trains to Cologne, Munich and other destinations.&#60;br /&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Zurich is the largest city of the Swiss Confederation (Switzerland) by land area and population. It is the financial centre of Switzerland and houses the stock exchange and the headquarters of a large number of national and international companies. National and international media agencies as well as most of the national TV channel companies are also located here.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Because Zurich is the central node of the Swiss-wide train network and also runs the biggest and busiest international airport in the country, it generally is the first place where tourists arrive. Because of the city&#38;#8217;s close distance to tourist resorts in the Swiss Alps and its mountainous scenery, it is often referred to as the &#38;#8220;portal to the Alps&#38;#8221;.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Contrary to what some believe, Zurich is not the capital of Switzerland&#38;ndash; that honor falls to Berne. Zurich has long been known for being clean and efficient. Due to this, it has been continuously ranked as the city with the highest living standard world-wide for many years. However, only for the last ten years has it truly become a fascinating and worthwhile travel destination. This is mostly thanks to the liberalization of the cultural, party and gastronomy sectors. An increasingly cosmopolitan population has helped, as well, though more button-down Geneva remains Switzerland&#38;#8217;s most culturally heterogeneous city.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Zurich Airport (IATA: ZRH) is Switzerland&#38;#8217;s largest and busiest airport run with Swiss efficiency. It is actually in the community of Kloten and it is 12 minutes by train from central Zurich. The trains depart about every 10-15 minutes but early morning and late evening connections are a bit less frequent, so if you travel at these times check the schedule. A single ticket to the Hauptbahnhof (Central Station) costs CHF 6.20. Several bus lines connect to the airport and provide access to the Winterthur region.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Most major airlines fly to Zurich but SWISS is still the Swiss flagcarrier and covers the biggest part of the international traffic at the airport. Almost every large hotel in Zurich provides shuttle buses from the airport to your hotel. The stops for these buses are a short walk to the right from Terminal 1 arrivals.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Zurich Airport has high passenger costs due to several noise reduction and approach restrictions. Most no-frill airlines fly to Basel which is 1 hour away by train. EasyJet resumed its flights to Zurich in 2007 after a three year absence and Air Berlin offers several flights to Germany and Southern Europe.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;If you are travelling without a Schengen Visa to another destination in Europe (via Zurich airport) and if you are not European citizen, you must not stay in Europe for longer than 90 days &#38;ndash; even if your final destination would allow citizens of your country to stay for more than 90 days. Failure to do so will lead to very high fines (around 8100 Euros) should you try to leave Europe via Zurich airport.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Most interesting sights:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Grossm&#38;uuml;nster,&#38;#160;Zwingliplatz. Old Romanesque church, symbol of reformed Zurich, where reformer Huldrych Zwingli was appointed the people&#38;#8217;s priest in 1519. Go up the tower for a great view of Zurich, though the stairs can be quite small and steep.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Fraum&#38;uuml;nster, K&#38;auml;mbelgasse 2. Old Gothic church (former convent) with window paintings made by Marc Chagall. No photos or videos allowed inside.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Landesmuseum, Museumstrasse 2,&#38;#160;&#60;abbr title=&#34;voice&#34;&#62;☎&#60;/abbr&#62;&#38;#160;+41 44 218 65 11. Tu-Su 10AM-5PM and most public holidays including M. The biggest Swiss history museum. You can also learn about the various traditions of the cantons comprising Switzerland. It&#38;#8217;s currently undergoing major refurbishment works until 2009 though many exhibitions are still open.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Kunsthaus,&#38;#160;&#60;abbr title=&#34;voice&#34;&#62;☎&#60;/abbr&#62;&#38;#160;+41 44 253 84 84. One of the major Swiss art museums. Its specialities are modern sculpturer Giacometti and the surrealist 18th Century painter Fuseli, both Swiss. Entry is free to the main collection Wednesdays.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Schanzengraben. A small canal that used to be part of the city fortifications between Limmat and Sihl. From the main station, go to Gessnerallee, find the stairways down to the tiny creek, and walk all the way to the lake.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Rietberg Museum, Gablerstrasse 15,&#38;#160;&#60;abbr title=&#34;voice&#34;&#62;☎&#60;/abbr&#62;&#38;#160;+41 (0)44 206 31 31. One of Europe&#38;#8217;s best collections of Asian art (mainly Indian drawings).&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Langstrasse. Red light district of Z&#38;uuml;rich, with more drug dealers and police than usual, but interesting because even this most notorious spot in Switzerland is so clean and safe. The area is the most overtly multicultural spot of the town. In recent years, ateliers and stylish bars start to coexist side by side to the about 15 strip clubs.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Zoo, Z&#38;uuml;richbergstrasse 221,&#38;#160;&#60;abbr title=&#34;voice&#34;&#62;☎&#60;/abbr&#62;&#38;#160;+41 44 254 25 05. With the new Masoala Rainforest Hall, the Zoo is really worth a visit!&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Lake Promenade. Especially during summer, the lake is a beautiful place to spend the evening or the weekend. Starting from Bellevue, the boardwalk goes for about three kilometers along the lake towards Tiefenbrunnen. About halfway from Bellevue there is a meadow where you will find thousands of people on a sunny day.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Chinese Garden,&#38;#160;&#60;abbr title=&#34;voice&#34;&#62;☎&#60;/abbr&#62;&#38;#160;+41 44 435 21 11. This small but beautiful Chinese garden was offered to the city of Zurich by the Chinese city of Kunming as symbol of gratitude after Zurich helped Kunming with technical knowledge.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Le Corbusier House, (near Chinese Garden). A beautiful, modern villa planned by the famous Swiss architect. The visiting hours are very limited (i.e. one day / week only in the summer) and entry is expensive. Additionally, there is a legal battle between the city (owner) and the long time tenant.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Lindenhof. The hill in the heart of the old town. A beautiful view of the city and one time location of a Roman fort.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Niederdorf. The old town offers beautiful alleys, restaurants and shopping mainly aimed at younger consumers. In the evenings, people visit the Niederdorf&#38;#8217;s many bars.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Bahnhofstrasse. One of the busiest and best known shopping streets in the world. Highly refined. Certainly a must-see for every tourist in Zurich! (see below).&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Museum Buehrle, Zollikerstrasse 172,&#38;#160;&#60;abbr title=&#34;voice&#34;&#62;☎&#60;/abbr&#62;&#38;#160;+41 44 422 00 86. A rich private art collection worth visiting &#38;ndash; although a little less rich after a recent brazen robbery in broad daylight. Call ahead, as it&#38;#8217;s currently not open during regular hours.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;Jacob Coffee Museum, Seefeldquai 17,&#38;#160;&#60;abbr title=&#34;voice&#34;&#62;☎&#60;/abbr&#62;&#38;#160;+41 44 388 61 51. An original museum which describes the evolution of coffee and different aspects of the culture that has developed around it. The museum is closed for renovation until March 2013.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Zurich West. This modern quarter used to be an industrial one, but modern urban developments made it into a center of vibrant night life.&#60;br /&#62;

Special fares on Business Class tickets. Discounted Business Class airline tickets. Business Class travel deals.</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;p&#62;Travelers should familiarize themselves with their destinations, both to get the most enjoyment out of the visit and to avoid known dangers. Travelers should also be aware of restrictions on items that may be taken overseas (see &#38;#8220;&#60;a href=&#34;https://travel.state.gov/travel/tips/tips_1232.html#medications&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;Bringing Medications or Filling Prescriptions Abroad&#60;/a&#62;,&#38;#8221; below) and even on items that may be brought into the U.S. upon return (see &#38;#8220;Customs and Import Restrictions,&#38;#8221; below). More information resources follow:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;The Consular Information Program&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The Consular Information Program consists of three main components that provide information to the American public about travel to specific countries: Country Specific Information, Travel Warnings and Travel Alerts. The U.S. Department of State issues fact sheets called Country Specific Information on over 200 countries. The sheets contain information on entry requirements, crime and security conditions, areas of instability, road safety and other details relevant to travel.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Save Money On Business Flight!&#38;#160;&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The Department of State also issues Travel Warnings and Travel Alerts.&#60;br /&#62;
    Travel warnings are issued when the State Department recommends deferral of travel by Americans to a country because of civil unrest, dangerous conditions, terrorist activity and, in some cases, because the U.S. has no diplomatic relations with the country and may have great difficulty in assisting Americans in distress. Travel Alerts are issued as a means to disseminate information quickly about terrorist threats and other relatively short-term or transnational conditions that could pose significant risks to American travelers.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;Alerts&#38;#160;are updated regularly and are accessible through the State Department&#38;#8217;s travel information website at&#38;#160;&#60;a href=&#34;https://travel.state.gov/content/travel.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://www.travel.state.gov.&#60;/a&#62;&#38;#160;For specific questions regarding an emergency involving an American citizen overseas, contact the Office of Overseas Citizens Services at (202) 647-5225.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;There are three ways to access Country Specific Information, Travel Warnings and Travel Alerts:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;On the Internet:&#38;#160;http:// travel.state.gov.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;By Fax:&#38;#160;on a fax machine, dial 202-647-3000 and follow the voice prompts.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;By Telephone:&#38;#160;dial (888) 407-4747 from within the U.S., or, from overseas, (202) 501-4444. These numbers are available from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday (except U.S. federal holidays).&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Background Notes&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Background Notes are factual publications that contain information on countries with which the United States has diplomatic relations. They include facts on each country&#38;#8217;s land, people, history, government, political conditions, economy, and relations with other countries and the United States. Background notes can be accessed via&#38;#160;&#60;a href=&#34;https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The State Department strongly encourages American citizens planning travel abroad to sign up for the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program.&#38;#160;The Smart Traveler Enrollment Program&#38;#160;makes it possible to contact a traveler if necessary, whether because of a family emergency in the United States or because of a crisis in the place the traveler is visiting.&#38;#160;It is a free service provided by the State Department, and is easily accomplished online at&#60;a href=&#34;https://travelregistration.state.gov/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; title=&#34;https://travelregistration.state.gov/&#34;&#62;&#38;#160;https://travelregistration.state.gov&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Note that, in accordance with the Privacy Act, the Department of State may not release information about those registered without their express written authorization.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;If your family needs to reach you because of an emergency, they can pass a message to you through the Office of Overseas Citizens Services, which can be contacted from within the United States at 1-888-407-4747 (toll free), and from overseas at 202-501-4444.&#38;#160;The Office of Overseas Citizens Services will contact the U.S. Embassy or Consulate in the country in which you are traveling in order to pass the message to you.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;The State Department also advises leaving a detailed itinerary and copies of your passport biographical-data page with a friend or relative in the United States.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;How&#38;#160;to Sign Up&#38;#160;(It&#38;#8217;s Easy)&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;If you decide to take your pet with you when you go abroad, you should check with the embassies of the destination countries as to specific requirements that must be met before a pet may be brought into the country. Many countries have strict health, quarantine, agriculture, wildlife, and customs requirements and prohibitions.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;Foreign embassy and consulate contact information can also be found on the Country Specific Information for each country.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Note:&#38;#160;In a crisis in which chartered or military aircraft or ships are used to evacuate Americans from a danger area, pets will not normally be permitted on the carrier. The pet owner will need to make other arrangements in order to remove the pet from the area. (Service animals, such as guide dogs, are not considered pets and will be accommodated if possible.)&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Cheap Business Class to Hong Kong&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Great Business Class Discount Hong Kong.&#38;#160;Luxury flights on world-class Cathay Pacific are now cheaper than ever. IFlyFirstClass, a leading luxury travel specialist, announced new last minute first class deals and discounts on business class tickets and first class flights aboard Cathay Pacific.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Cathay Pacific: &#38;quot;People. They Make an Airline&#38;quot;&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Based in Hong Kong, Cathay Pacific is the world&#38;#39;s largest airline and serves 168 destinations in 42 countries. The airline and its subsidiary DragonAir transport 27 million passengers each year. Cathay Pacific operates seven additional wholly owned subsidiaries and has interest in six other brands, including VN/CX Catering Services, Air Hong Kong and Air China.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Known around the world for its lavish attention to detail and affluent services, the airline is frequently recognized for its signature style. At the 2013 World Airline Awards alone, the air carrier received nearly a dozen designations, including:&#60;br /&#62;
    &#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;ul&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;No. 1 Best Cabin Staff,&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;No. 3 Best In-flight Entertainment,&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;No. 6 Best Airline in the World and&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;li&#62;No. 7 Best Cabin Cleanliness.&#60;/li&#62;
    &#60;/ul&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Cathay Pacific Creates a Luxury Experience at the Airport&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Vaunted for its premium class airport lounges, the airline&#38;#39;s first class lounge at its main Hong Kong International Airport hub is extraordinarily lush. The Wing lounge sports walls covered in natural Eucalyptus, exquisite black marble flooring and the airline&#38;#39;s hand-crafted Solus Chair. The Champagne Bar, The Haven restaurant, private shower suites and The Cabanas&#38;#39; napping areas help travelers refresh, recharge and relax in consummate luxury. The Hong Kong airport is also home to other stellar premium class lounges, including The Cabin and The Pier. In Hong Kong and at airports around the world, Cathay Pacific&#38;#39;s lounges are designed to present a luxurious atmosphere and services that well-heeled travelers expect.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;line-height: 1.2em;&#34;&#62;Travelers Bask in First Class Amenities&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The air carrier is well-known for its outstanding first class cabins, seats and catering. Offering the utmost in privacy and gracious service, Cathay Pacific&#38;#39;s first class cabins hold only six to nine seats, each with its own direct access to the aisle and spacious setting. Passengers relish personal on-demand entertainment systems, private wardrobes, high-end amenity kits, large 17-inch television monitors and fresh gourmet meals.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Passengers Take Pleasure in Business Class Spaciousness&#38;#160;&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;New business class seats adjust to multiple positions for maximum comfort aboard Cathay Pacific&#38;#39;s business class cabins. Seats also move forward to enhance privacy and slide back so that passengers can chat with fellow travelers. At the seats&#38;#39; ultimate recline, they offer an 82-inch long flat bed featuring additional hip support and extra knee space. State-of-the-art entertainment systems present more than 100 movies, 500 television shows and 70 games in 10 languages on a generously sized touch screen monitor.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Helping travelers find outstanding luxury airfare deals,&#38;#160;IFlyFirstClass&#38;#160;today revealed its top tips to saving money on last minute flights. A leading travel service providing discount premium flights around the world, IFlyFirstClass is dedicated to making luxury travel more accessible and affordable for all travelers.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#38;quot;Most airlines offers some incredible last minute deals, but many people do not know how to access those discounts,&#38;quot; notes Julia Graft, IFlyFirstClass public relations manager. &#38;quot;By offering a few industry tips, we hope to encourage travelers to seek out these deals and consider traveling to exciting international destinations amid the luxury of business and first class cabins.&#38;quot;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Some of IFlyFirstClass&#38;#39; best suggestions on finding fantastic&#38;#160;&#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/page/last-minute-deals&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; title=&#34;last minute business class&#34;&#62;last minute premium flight deals&#60;/a&#62;&#38;#160;include:&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;1. Embrace Flexibility.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    Having a little leeway on travel dates, departure cities, destinations and trip accommodations can save travelers hundreds of dollars. While some emergency situations may not allow travelers to be flexible about flight dates, many major cities around the world boast several airports within a couple of hours&#38;#39; drive. San Francisco-bound travelers, for example, might consider nearby airports in Oakland and San Jose for cheaper fares. London itself boasts six airports, many of which may be cheaper than titan Heathrow. Potential passengers should also consider that there may be savings to be found by booking the trip as a package, including lodging, car rentals and attraction tickets.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;2. Timing is Everything.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    Late night and early morning flights are often less expensive than midday routes on regular flights, and that caveat holds true for last minute&#38;#160;&#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; title=&#34;cheap business class&#34;&#62;luxury flights&#60;/a&#62;&#38;#160;as well. Similarly, midweek travel is generally cheaper, so travelers should aim for flying on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;3. Upgrade your expectations.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    Last minute business and&#38;#160;&#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/service/first-class-specials&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; title=&#34;cheap business class&#34;&#62;first class rates&#60;/a&#62;&#38;#160;are frequently less expensive than last minute coach prices, so passengers who normally travel in coach should take a look at last minute business class fares, and those who regularly fly in business class should seek out last minute first class prices.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;4. Check Early and Often.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    Major airlines release most last minute airfare deals on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays in hopes of luring last-minute weekend travelers. Potential travelers should get in the habit of occasionally checking airfare and airline sites so they know what airline tickets in their region generally cost.IFlyFirstClass suggests that prospective passengers sign up for the major air carriers&#38;#39; weekly emails to stay on top of the deals and watch their pricing trends.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;5. Book and Fly At A Moment&#38;#39;s Notice.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    Last minute first class deals aren&#38;#39;t often available for long periods of time, so travelers should be ready to act on any good deals they find as quickly as possible. In many cases, the best last minutes discounts are available for flights within the next week, to passengers should be ready to travel quickly.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;6. Check with A Travel Company Specializing in&#38;#160;Discount Luxury Travel.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Experience the cheap last minute business class to Australia. You&#38;#39;ll live the life of the rich and famous, jetting away in the splendor of first class fares or spacious business class seats to a private tropical island equipped to cater to your every need. From amazing coral cays along the Great Barrier Reef and &#38;quot;motu&#38;quot; in Tahiti to Fiji&#38;#39;s verdant islands, the only difficult part of a private island escape is deciding which Polynesian paradise to choose. We&#38;#39;ve compiled a list of our favorite South Pacific luxury island retreats; here is our first installment showcasing sumptuous islands in Australia and New Zealand.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;No Worries in the Land Down Under&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Leave cold Northern winters behind to bask in the gleaming sunshine and warm water of the Great Barrier Reef. Settle into the balmy Tropic of Capricorn on spectacular Heron Island, known for its incredible dive sites and soft-sand beaches. Reserve the entire island or a luscious resort suite, and revel in the sumptuous amenities, guided ecological walks, tennis courts and swimming pool and evening cinema presentations. Take a short boat ride to the more secluded Wilson Island, where the coral island&#38;#39;s fine sand offers a unique habitat for rare turtle and bird breeding grounds.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Australia&#38;#39;s coast offers plenty of other full-service island choices. Take a walk on the wild side and chance an encounter with Lizard Island&#38;#39;s immense Monitor Lizards, relax in Orpheus Island&#38;#39;s sheltered bay or experience the pampering amenities and incredible oceanside villas on the Whitsundays&#38;#39; Hayman Island. Mostly islands are located off Australia&#38;#39;s east and northeast coasts, so reserve first class fares to Brisbane or Cairns to connect with island transfers via seaplane, helicopter and yacht.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Haere Mai, Welcome to New Zealand&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;We love New Zealand for its casual, engaging approach to life, and its islands are just as enticing. Wooded hills, pristine beaches and frolicking dolphins create a tranquil respite on Marlborough Sounds&#38;#39; Forsyth Island. Snuggled between New Zealand&#38;#39;s North and South islands, Forsyth is the quintessential Kiwi adventure, complete with welcoming lodge, marvelous cuisine and bountiful water sports. To get there, settle into comfortable business class seats to Wellington, and transfer to Forsyth aboard a breathtaking 20-minute helicopter ride.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;Off New Zealand&#38;#39;s Coromandel Peninsula, Slipper Island is less remote yet equally appealing, with traditional bure-styled chalets facing gorgeous beaches and an inviting inland lodge. Wreck-diving, wind surfing and deep-sea fishing are just a few island activities. A luscious first class fare to Auckland will deliver you near the serene Kiwi island, and a quick boat transfer, helicopter ride or private flight can take you the rest of the way.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Luxuriating in your own South Pacific island retreat is the perfect way to spend the holidays or start the new year.

    &#60;p&#62;When you and your family decide to go abroad on a long vacation to spend some time away from home, you have to think about the budget.

This is especially true when you are travelling to another part of the world. This is the reason why most people are forced to pre-book months in advance. While you may do this and save a little on the overall cost, there are more disadvantages than the good. Booking several months in advance can cause many problems. A person or a working couple cannot ask for a leave two months in advance from their workplace. If you assume that you will be granted a leave and at the end you are not, then you may have to sell your tickets or cancel the booking, incurring more loss.

    &#60;p&#62;In case you are an executive or the owner of a recently launched company, then there is no alternative left for you rather than travel by the best flight. This is because it comes down to reputation and affects the way people look at you. If you are a frequent flyer, then you can make use of your frequent flier miles card that many airliners provide. You can redeem the miles covered for points and use them to get the best deals business class. This is an option that not many people make use of even though it is perfect for executives.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Studies indicate that taking a vacation every now and then has proven to improve mental and emotional health exponentially. Luxurious travel often seems to be impossible with many travel agents booking as per their convenience without taking care of the needs of the traveler. They fail to understand that luxury comes at a price that you are willing to pay, because as working professionals, we desire the finer things in life after toiling for years without a vacation. Once you do take a vacation, you want it to be opulence personified with each comfort taken care of. Instead of being privy to miscommunication and misunderstandings by talking to a travel agent, why not use websites that enable you to book your whole tour online? With a few mouse clicks, you can purchase a last minute first class ticket with ease.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Many working professionals want their trip to be meticulously planned. You can choose the airline you wish to fly to and the seat can also be pre-selected before procuring your boarding pass. This makes travel so much easy and the freedom of choice is provided by very few agents. Imagine travelling with your favorite Singapore Airlines and being welcomed by an assortment of appetizers and refreshing cocktails. The service is exceptional with air hostesses available at your beck and call. Plush comforters, soft pillows and hot towels are given to you as you are seated. Choosing a window seat with your one way business class ticket will allow you to watch the city drift by as the clouds gradually seem to engulf it and you climb higher into the atmosphere. You will be sound asleep within the confines of the plane and blissfully slip into a deep slumber. If you wish to watch a multitude of movies and television shows on the display in front of you, you can do so.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;The same website will also provide you free airport transfer and you can arrange your accommodation from the list of hotels. Some hotels will even provide popular sightseeing packages and bed and breakfast options to passengers. You should make use of this and book everything in order to avoid receiving anything less than what you want. Walk through the piazzas of Rome; eat a sumptuous mee goreng in Singapore or belly-dance in the dessert in Dubai without worrying about your travel arrangements or getting affected by minor mishaps. You need not have a return date, as websites provide one way first class tickets and roundabout trips in which you wish to travel the whole world. Their flexibility and multitude of destinations makes them a sought after choice for travelers with a selective taste and preference for opulence.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Your comfort need not come at a high price, as these websites provide tickets at affordable rates. Since the need for a travel agent and his commission is eliminated, these sites transfer the savings they incur onto customers which makes it all the more enticing. Take an impromptu vacation, catch that last minute meeting or rush to your friend&#38;#8217;s wedding in a foreign country by using these websites.&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The Wing first class lounge is Cathay Pacific&#38;#39;s signature lounge, a favorite of savvy travelers and recently renovated to continue its legacy as one of the best in the world. From top-notch furnishings and exquisite detailing to pampering service, the lounge fulfills every passenger need. Passengers sip bubbly in the champagne bar, dine on the finest fare in The Haven and relax in shower-equipped cabanas.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Cathay Pacific&#38;#39;s multi-level The Wing business class lounge in the Hong Kong Airport is equally vaunted. White carrera marble surrounds a scrumptious buffet of Asian and Western dishes, and plentiful shower suites feature warm bamboo and Travertine stone. Its legendary Noodle Bar and The Long Bar offer more edible treasures as does The Coffee Bar.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    New and innovative services continue to be added to first and business class lounges across the globe.

    &#60;h3&#62;Discount Business Class Tickets&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Staying connected while in the air is easier than ever with new and ever-expanding Internet services on the nation&#38;#39;s biggest airlines. Customer demand for business class first discounted tickets. With an accelerating pace of expanding Wi-Fi networks, increasing speeds, improving function and widening global service coverage, in-air Internet offerings are expected to balloon in the next three years.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Current In-Air Offerings&#60;br /&#62;
    In-flight Internet pioneer GogoAir created the very first in-air wireless broadband network in the world and now provides total in-flight broadband coverage across the continental United States on more than 2,000 commercial aircraft and more than 6,500 business aircraft. Its air-to-ground network in North America is one of the most extensive in the world, and it&#38;#39;s expanding and innovating to meet growing demand.&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
    Its comprehensive network and stellar track record for robust coverage has led to partnerships with many of North America&#38;#39;s top airlines. Currently, passengers can access GogoAir&#38;#39;s in-flight connections on Aeromexico, American Airlines, Air Canada, AirTran, Alaska Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, United Airlines, US Airways and Virgin America.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Streaming movies and videos in-flight is a developing service. While most networks need more bandwidth and stronger signals to provide a satisfying streaming experience, GogoAir offers about 100 on-demand movies to its customers. These GogoAir in-flight entertainments options can be found on partner air carriers such as Aeromexico, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Scoot and US Airways.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    In the Future: Expanded, International Coverage and Faster Connections&#60;br /&#62;
    While a recent study published by the World Bank reported that the U.S., Canada and Germany have the most extensive in-air Internet networks, other countries and regions are recognizing its importance. After all, no country can afford to be the dead zone for Internet service in an otherwise robust coverage area.&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;Faster, stronger, wider and more reliable coverage is already in the works for many in-air broadband services. GogoAir, for example, will soon offer its 2Ku network that uses a series of satellites to provide complete connectivity, even over oceans and distant lands. Travelers can expect to see connectivity broaden on international flights and become more reliable with these expansions.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Increasing connection speed is another top priority. One provider announced this spring that it will debut a new satellite in 2017 that will deliver in-flight connection speeds at 200 Mbps.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Paving the way for more innovation, some current restrictions on in-air mobile device uses are being eliminated. The European Commission recently approved a resolution to allow passengers to make 3G and 4G cell phone calls once they&#38;#39;re above 3,000 feet. Fliers passing through EU airspace will also be able to text and use their mobile devices.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Whether flying internationally or domestically, busy clients of leading luxury travel service IFlyFirstClass need to be able to stay in touch with their offices, partners and clients throughout their flights. For that reason, IFlyFirstClass always recommends that its travelers choose first and business class flights with the most reliable and extensive networks available.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Ultimately, industry experts believe these growing in-flight Wi-Fi networks will lead to more sophisticated services with a complete range of low-cost connectivity. Leading the way in this effort is in-air broadband pioneer GogoAir.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Bustling, historic, fashionable and mysterious, London is the busiest destination in the world. Knowledgeable travelers who choose to have a&#38;#160;business class flight deals to London&#38;#160;just as spectacular as the destination, count on IFlyFirstClass for cheap business class flights and discounted first class seats. With the best deals first class has to offer, travelers can rest assured that they have plenty of money and energy left to explore The Smoke.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h4&#62;Exciting London&#60;/h4&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Known for its stellar architecture, powerful international acumen, trend-setting music and fashion scenes and fascinating royalty, London is a whirlwind of activity. With the Thames River running alongside some of the city&#38;#39;s most iconic landmarks like the Palace of Westminster and Big Ben, the London Eye and the Tower of London, the city sports some of the most picturesque landscapes around.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Politicos and royal-watchers enjoy taking in the legendary 10 Downing Street residence of the prime minister and the official royal family residence at Buckingham Palace. Westminster Abbey is also a favorite destination for its role in elaborate coronations and royal weddings. Equally fascinating are St. Paul&#38;#39;s Cathedral, Kew Gardens, Trafalgar Square, Windsor Castle and Kensington Palace.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h4&#62;Modern Landmarks with Awesome Views&#60;/h4&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;As a dynamic, innovative city, London excels at blending its stunning new structures into its historic districts. Creating spectacular views of the city, the London Eye presents magnificent views of Westminster Palace, and the super-modern Shard building gives guests a 72-story-high vista of the city. In addition to its captivating architecture, The Gherkin also tempts visitors to take a peek at London from 41 stories in the air.&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;h4&#62;Center Stage in London&#38;#39;s Art Scene&#60;/h4&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The famous West End is the heart of London&#38;#39;s theater district and a must-see for musical theater lovers. Nearby, Picadilly Circus overflows with exciting restaurants, nightclubs and neon signs that give it a Times Square vibe. Fashion houses and upscale shops fill Oxford and Bond streets, and the renowned Tate Modern houses dozens of modern art exhibits.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h4&#62;Mysterious London&#60;/h4&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The city is infamous for its macabre, unsolved murders, ghostly apparitions and often-violent political machinations of the past. Visitors can trail the killing grounds of Jack the Ripper, trudge through a camped-up tour of the London Dungeon, ride a Ghost Bus, take the Blood and Tears Walk and explore the history-filled Highgate Cemetery.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Get the business first one way class to China.&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Drawn to vast China&#38;#39;s deep artistic, spiritual and historic heritage and the second largest economy in the world, business and pleasure travelers thrill to their Chinese adventures. Experienced travelers make their trek to China in affordable luxury, thanks to IFlyFirstClass&#38;#39; discounted business class and cheap first class flights. The leading premium travel service accesses the very best deals first class can offer so that travelers can save thousands on high-end airfare and enjoy the long flight to gorgeous China.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h4&#62;The Land Of The Sleeping Giant&#38;#160;&#60;/h4&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;A journey to China can span from the country&#38;#39;s cosmopolitan urban cities on the east coast to the rich river deltas in the central area and on to the picturesque Inner Mongolian grasslands of the west. As the country with the world&#38;#39;s largest population, it&#38;#39;s no surprise that China boasts a few other peerless features. Its Mount Everest is the world&#38;#39;s tallest mountain; its Gobi Desert is 1,000 miles wide; its high-speed magnetic levitation train reaches an unheard-of 300 miles an hour and its Great Wall spans more than 13,000 miles. All are spectacular experiences for visitors to China.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h4&#62;Chinese Adventures&#60;/h4&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;With vast landscapes and climates, China presents a variety of recreation activities, from rafting down the country&#38;#39;s mighty rivers and soaking in Yalong Bay&#38;#39;s tropical beach wonderlands to traipsing across hundreds of glacier on Xinjiang&#38;#39;s Mount Tomur and cycling along Xian&#38;#39;s great wall. Whatever thrill-seeking visitors enjoy, they&#38;#39;ll be glad they traveled to the country in the restful comfort of IFlyFirstClass&#38;#39; discounted business class and first class seat.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;Cultural Discoveries&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Visitors can explore the country&#38;#39;s many temples and churches to gain insight into China&#38;#39;s traditional architecture, religion and culture. And, since the country has been home to a variety of religions, visitors can explore how many different faiths shaped China&#38;#39;s regions. In the 6th century, for instance, the Tiantai branch of Buddhism was formed with the creation of Mount Tiantai&#38;#39;s Guoging Temple. Decades later, Islam was first introduced into Chinese culture in Ghangzhou City. That city remains home to one of the oldest mosques in the world, the Huaisheng Mosque, built in 627 A.D. With the building of the Trans-Siberian Railway came Russian influence, seen in Saint Sophia Cathedral&#38;#39;s onion domes. And, in a country as expansive as China, there are dozens of other temples, churches and cathedrals to experience.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;Last Minute Emirates Flights&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Business first last minute flights to Emirates are watiign for you!&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Emirates launched its new Chicago-to-Dubai nonstop route earlier this month with a Grand Ballroom gala at the Navy Pier, and Donna Cherry, CTO of IFlyFirstClass was there to help celebrate. As a leading luxury travel service, IFlyFirstClass is always delighted when a proven luxury airline extends its routes to the U.S., but Emirates&#38;#39; unparalleled service and amenities is of particular interest to the company.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    &#38;quot;With our global economy expanding, travel between the U.S. and the Middle East is vital for hundreds of Midwest entrepreneurs and executives,&#38;quot; said Donna with I Fly First Class. &#38;quot;We are excited to work with Emirates to deliver our clients to the Persian Gulf and beyond in the luxury of direct first and business class flights from Chicago.&#38;quot;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    The addition of the Emirates daily flights between Chicago and Dubai makes Chicago the second U.S. market to provide service from three major airlines based in the Middle East. Etihad entered the market in 2010 and Qatar Airlines began offering flights from Chicago to Doha in 2013.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    &#38;quot;IFlyFirstClassclients require convenience, luxury and value, and Emirates&#38;#39; entry into the Chicago market gives us a terrific option to provide to our customers,&#38;quot; said XXXXXX. &#38;quot;Known for its award-winning service and cabins, the Chicago-to-Dubai flights help our clients connect with their business interests in Dubai and 140 other global destinations.&#38;quot;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Those flying Emirates&#38;#39; new nonstop route will enjoy first, business and economy class fares on the airline&#38;#39;s spacious Boeing 777 aircraft. IFlyFirstClass has already added the new route to its offerings and is pleased to book its clients into Emirates&#38;#39; first and business class cabins.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    These new nonstop routes consist of flight EK236, leaving O&#38;#39;Hare International Airport at 8:35 p.m. and arriving in Dubai at 7:10 p.m. aboard the Boeing 777-200LR aircraft. Return flight, EK235, flies out of Dubai International Airport on alternate days at 9:45 a.m. and arrives in Chicago at 3:25 p.m.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;At Emirates&#38;#39; launch gala, company executives announced that 85 percent of the company&#38;#39;s flights for August were already booked.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Local dignitaries welcomed Emirates executives and the arrival of the very first Emirates flight to O&#38;#39;Hare International Airport on August 5 with plenty of fanfare. Continuing the celebration, the airline&#38;#39;s August 6 gala attracted more than 500 travel industry executives, business leaders and VIPs to the event, including IFlyFirstClass&#38;#39; Donna Cherry.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Offering just a taste of the luxury Emirates&#38;#39; passengers can expect aboard the Chicaco-to-Dubai flight, the launch gala pulled out all the stops. Emirates Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Adel Al Redha greeted Chicago Deputy Mayor Steven Koch and the other 500-plus guests to an evening full of sumptuous treats. For the cocktail reception, Emirates&#38;#39; acclaimed cabin crew staff offered guests everything from cool hand towels to succulent traditional dates, canapes and Arabic coffee. Once the Grand Ballroom opened, guests dined on poached lobster, fillet with roasted potatoes, vegetable medley and a selection of desserts. The apex of the evening was a concert by Grammy award winning artist Lionel Ritchie.&#60;br /&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;First class fares discount to Hong Kong&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;With business class cabins inching their way towards first class quality amenities, airlines are creating increasingly sumptuous first class cabins to compete for the attention of the world&#38;#39;s most discerning travelers. With hundreds of millions of dollars being spent across the industry to create the most luxurious first class cabins, three air carriers exceed all expectations and deliver unqualified, superior first class service.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h4&#62;Etihad Airways&#60;/h4&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Ensconced in rich, earthen tones, Etihad&#38;#39;s luxurious first class cabins are a revelation. Frequently named the world&#38;#39;s top first class airline by various industry groups, Etihad&#38;#39;s reputation for superb service and posh accommodations elevates travelers&#38;#39; expectations and spurs its competitors.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    On board Etihad&#38;#39;s first class, individual suites contain extra-wide seats with built-in massage functions enclosed by beautifully decorated sliding doors for the ultimate privacy. At bedtime, seats convert to 6-foot, 8-inch beds covered with fitted sheets, Dupioni silk and cotton duvets topped with full-sized pillows. Every detail is perfectly executed, from the Poltrona Frau leather upholstery to the personal minibar and wardrobes. The personal chef catering to passengers&#38;#39; palates, individual changing rooms, and Swarovski Elements amenity kits with La Prairie skin care products complete the mile-high posh service.&#60;/p&#62;
    <is_top>True</is_top>
    &#60;h4&#62;Lufthansa&#60;/h4&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Exceptional German innovation, engineering and precision create some of the most luscious amenities and attentive services available aboard Lufthansa&#38;#39;s award-winning first class cabins. Forget pedestrian seats that convert to beds. Lufthansa&#38;#39;s 747 first class cabins offer passengers a seat and a separate 77-inch-long bed.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Passengers aboard the air carrier&#38;#39;s new A380s enjoy extra comfort thanks to automated air humidifiers, the first of their kind in the industry. Fliers sip on wine selected by a world champion sommelier, indulge in a caviar course and dine on exquisite meals designed by some of the world&#38;#39;s best chefs. Slumber is peaceful in Lufthansa&#38;#39;s first class cabins, with temperature-regulating duvets, soundproof curtains and footfall sound insulation nestled beneath the first class cabin carpet.&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;It should come as no surprise that the emirate that is home to extraordinary skyscrapers and some of the world&#38;#39;s largest and most elaborate mad-made islands and shopping centers would produce one of the most uncommonly luxurious airlines. First class passengers on Dubai-based Emirates enjoy super-private suites, each outfitted with a personal minibar, vanity table, wardrobe, mirror and a plush seat that converts to a comfy flat bed.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    The pi&#38;egrave;ce de r&#38;eacute;sistance is the first class cabin shower spas, offering in-air hot showers, spa products, fluffy towels and a roomy marble vanity. Passengers enjoy refreshments at onboard lounges and dine in luxury on regional dishes such as stir-fried lobster in black bean sauce. And, of course, meals are served on Royal Doulton fine bone china with Robert Welch cutlery.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    With top airlines continually improving their first class services in order to meet the changing demands of upscale travelers, there are plenty of spectacular amenities and services available on today&#38;#39;s air carriers.

    &#60;p&#62;With billions of dollars invested in purchasing new aircraft and retrofitting existing airplanes over the past three years, the world&#38;#39;s top air carriers just keep improving their business class and first class options. Increasingly, business class services are on a par with some first class, and first class seats are nearly over the top with luxurious amenities. This ever-escalating quality of business class flight offerings makes it tricky to cull out the world&#38;#39;s best business class fares. But, we like our savvy travelers to be on top of the latest in travel news, so here&#38;#39;s IFlyFirstClass&#38;#39; picks for the top 10 business class flights.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    At No. 10 is the often-overlooked Korean Air, with its refreshingly light cabins, exquisitely attentive service and Prestige sleeper flat beds. Travelers looking to unwind on board are delighted to find a Celestial Lounge, and those who just can&#38;#39;t get enough of duty-free shopping can continue their browsing at the world&#38;#39;s only in-air duty-free shop.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Turkish Airlines understands that you can never go wrong with a pre-meal snack of Godiva chocolate and Turkish Deligh. The No. 9 business class fare includes lush amenity kits, cushy slippers, free wireless Internet, complimentary tours of Istanbul, a luscious culinary menu and comfortable lie-flat beds.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Dubai&#38;#39;s Emirates business class is the epitome of luxury, from the incredibly spacious A380 business class cabins to chauffeur service. The No. 8 airline has made a name for itself in luxury travel circles for its sumptuous amenities, entertainment options, in-air bar and refined meal service.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Innovative Virgin Atlantic&#38;#39;s friendly and open atmosphere rings in at No. 7 on our list. The company&#38;#39;s long-haul business class flights offer it all: fully flat beds, privacy, on-board high-speed Internet, pajamas, large amenity kits and engaging, responsive service.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    With one of the longest-held reputations for polished service and plentiful amenities, Qantas&#38;#39; business class seats continue to please. Lie-flat beds offer relaxing massage options, meals are palate-pleasing and personal on-demand entertainment systems help pass the time.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Privacy and service are the hallmarks of Etihad&#38;#39;s business class fares. Lush full-flat beds, fine dining and wine pairings are in-air luxuries, matched by personal chauffeur door-to-door limousine service on the ground.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;Stretch out in luxury on Oman Air&#38;#39;s full-flat 77-and-a-half-inch beds and backrests that adjust with the touch of a button. The on-board entertainment system syncs with travelers&#38;#39; own devices for a full-range of entertainment options.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Qatar&#38;#39;s business class service is pure pampering from the moment you head to the airport. Chauffeurs whisk passengers to private terminals to board the airline&#38;#39;s fresh, new 787 Dreamliners. In-air cocktail lounges, ample work and storage space, large windows with touch control and noise-cancelling headphones make the journey a pleasurable event.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Although at No. 2, Cathay Pacific is no slouch in the luxury arena, providing extra-long lie-flat beds with hip supports, storage cabinets, a state-of-the-art rotating library of endless entertainment and high-end cuisine. The airline is also famous for its plush business class lounges, incredibly attentive service and reasonable pricing.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    At the top of our list is Singapore Airlines, where business class flights specialize in effortless luxury. Every detail is tastefully executed, from solicitous crew and sophisticated culinary service to the widest business class seat in the industry. Passengers also enjoy direct aisle access, discriminating amenity kits and extensive entertainment options.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Plenty of other airlines made our honorable mention list, as most business class fares are full of gracious services and appointments. Whether you choose to go with top-rated Singapore Airlines or our No. 10 Korean Air, sumptuous journeys await.&#60;/p&#62;

That&#38;#39;s good news for elite travelers who can expect the competitive nature of the industry to offer increasingly opulent products and greater first class flight value. To help savvy flyers find the best first class seats in the world, IFlyFirstClass offers its selection for the top five best first class cabins for 2014.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    The rapid growth of Middle Eastern and Asian airlines has helped push the industry toward more lush first class accommodations, and Abu Dhabi-based Etihad is one of the leaders. Its new Residences and First Class Apartment options on the Airbus A380 put it at the top of our list. The Residence class is a three-room suite on the A380&#38;#39;s upper deck, providing a bedroom, sitting room and en suite bathroom and shower. The Residence comes with a private butler and personal chef in the air and complimentary chauffeur service on the ground. The Apartments are also on the upper deck of the A380 and are the epitome of privacy and spacious in-air luxury. They feature a full-size vanity, a leather armchair and a sofa-ottoman that converts to a completely flat bed. Even better, the partition between two apartments can be removed to create a double bed and larger travel space for couples flying together.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    At No. 2, Singapore Airlines is no less luxurious. Its first class seats are over-sized and separate from the full-sized bed that is included in the first class suites. Sliding doors encase the suites for full privacy, and the space is filled with amenities like the KrisWorld entertainment system, Book the Cook culinary options and Dom P&#38;eacute;rignon, all graciously supplied by the company&#38;#39;s signature Singapore Girl service.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Always sumptuous, Cathay Pacific&#38;#39;s first class fares are at No. 3, welcoming passengers with Krug Grand Cuv&#38;eacute;e and a host of pampering features. Dine on five-star cuisine created by the Mandarine Oriental Hotel, slip into complimentary PYE lounge wear, freshen up with an AESOP amenity kit and savor the entertainment with BOSE headphones. Supremely comfortable seats with touch-screen controls convert to equally capacious beds topped with fine bedding. The seat also offers a massage function to help passengers work out the travel kinks.&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;No. 4 Emirates may be topping this list next year, as they plan to debut their own full-scale suite sometime in the future. For now, their first class fares are already stellar, offering sliding-door privacy, leather reclining seats, cozy pajamas, Iranian caviar, Dom P&#38;eacute;rignon, a vanity mirror, wardrobe, minibar and access to a shower spa. Dubai-based Emirates also offers its first class passengers complimentary limousine service.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Although not as private as some of the other first class flights on our Top 5 list, Air France&#38;#39;s first class seats provide a breath of fresh air. Eminently stylish, the air carrier&#38;#39;s new La Premi&#38;egrave;re suite presents a light and airy ambiance, clad in leather, suede and classy tweed. Seats are extra-wide and convert to a long, flat bed, and curtains can be closed to give the occupants extra privacy without feeling closed-in. A comfy ottoman/small armchair offers extra seating for companions, and a personal entertainment system is viewed on a 24-inch high definition television monitor.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;We can find the best first class deals specials&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Luxury living at 30,000 feet doesn&#38;#39;t require a private, customized plane if you book first class flights aboard Etihad&#38;#39;s newest revelation: first class apartments. Complete with a large Poltrona Frau leather armchair and a spacious ottoman/bed combination, these first class apartments will line the upper deck of Etihad&#38;#39;s new Airbus 380 along with Etihad&#38;#39;s luxurious residence suites and business class studios.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Setting the Stage&#60;br /&#62;
    Premium passengers enter the upper deck to a welcoming, upscale lobby that resembles a warm, boutique hotel entrance. Passengers proceed to their apartments down a broad, 27-inch aisle that allows passengers to pass each other comfortably. Just beyond the first class apartments, the space is filled with an inviting, full-serviced lounge area for passengers to use throughout the flight when they want to eat, drink or work in the company of others.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    With a vibe that&#38;#39;s more upscale cruise line cabin than first class seat, these apartments are completely ensconced in their own private world. Stylish sliding doors invite passengers into their apartments, where 64-inch tall walls provide luxurious privacy. The spacious 39 square foot apartment is completely free of overhead bins and bulkheads, giving passengers a roomy, open and airy space that feels as far removed from cramped flying as possible. Each apartment has one to three windows, an unheard-of feature in the industry, and ambient lighting is employed throughout the cabin to create an enticing, comfortable environment.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    First Class Amenities&#60;br /&#62;
    The custom leather-clad apartment is filled with luscious perks, from a swiveled and fully adjustable 24-inch flat screen monitor to a spacious wardrobe and a full-size lighted vanity. A chilled drinks cabinet, noise-cancelling headsets, complimentary lounge wear, total in-flight connectivity and the services of a highly trained chef ensure that first class apartment passengers luxuriate in their flight time.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    The custom leather armchair itself is a luxury, with 30 inches of breadth, pleasing recline functions and a Lantal pneumatic cushion system. And, if passengers want to freshen up during the flight, they can avail themselves of a fully equipped first class shower room.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;Stretch Out and Relax&#60;br /&#62;
    Although the apartment&#38;#39;s extra seating/sleeping area is billed as an &#38;quot;ottoman,&#38;quot; it is more like a sofa than a footstool and can seat up to three visitors for comfortable on-board socializing. The attentive turn-down service reveals that the ottoman is an 80.5-inch completely flat bed with hand-crafted, all-natural mattresses, duvets and pillows. Etihad also invested in state-of-the-art technology developed specifically for their first class apartment beds. This articulating, transverse mechanism maximizes the bed space for sleeping, stowage and socializing. The partition between two apartments can also be removed to create a comfortable double bed and extra living space for passengers traveling together.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Luxury On the Ground&#60;br /&#62;
    As if in-air pampering isn&#38;#39;t enough, Etihad provides complimentary chauffeur service on the ground for its first class flight passengers. And, at its home-base Abu Dhabi Airport, Etihad porters and concierges meet passengers curbside and whisk them away to a special reception area. There, passengers enjoy five-star dining, complimentary spa treatments and a score of entertainment options.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Etihad&#38;#39;s new A380 aircraft and its first class apartments take off in December of 2014 on routes between Abu Dhabi and London Heathrow. Flights to New York, Paris, Melbourne and Sydney are expected to begin in 2015.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Fine dining, free-flowing champagne, best business fares one way,&#38;#160;attentive service, special turn-down service and dozens of other pampering amenities make first class flights utterly appealing. Sadly, those plentiful perks and services also come with a high cost that can make them seem completely unattainable. But, with these helpful tips to finding cheap first class fares, luck and savings are in your corner.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    As a leading discount premium travel company, IFlyFirstClass always advocates using its services or a similar enterprise to find discount first class tickets. Because they specialize in cheap first class fares and business class seats, they know all the tricks of the trade for finding reduced luxury fares. It&#38;#39;s also the best option for saving time and energy in the hunt for first class specials. A quick phone call or an online travel request form is all it takes for the service to find the very best first class deals available.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    If travelers are determined to go it alone, there are a few other tips for finding the best first class airfare deals around. First, travelers should be flexible on the day and time of their flights. Red-eyes may be uncomfortable in coach class, but with a comfy first class seat and bed, the flight may be much more restful, especially if there&#38;#39;s savings to be had. Similarly, the day of the week can make a difference. Travel on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Saturdays is less in demand, so bargain first class flights may be more available on those days.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    One of the happiest and least dependable ways to find cheap first class fares is to hope for a first class upgrade on your coach or business class ticket. There are several ways to make a complimentary upgrade more likely. Joining airline loyalty programs, a willingness to be bumped to another flight and checking in first for your flight may provide better chances for upgrades, but there&#38;#39;s never a guarantee.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;Several websites offer tips and knowledgeable advice in how to find cheap first class deals, even on typically pricey itineraries like one way first class flights and last minute first class fares. There are many knowledgeable travelers and agents on sites like FlyerTalk who can help guide travelers on finding great first class deals.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Accruing travel points with travel rewards credit cards, airline cards and hotel cards are great ways to lessen the cost of a first class flight. All flights and points systems are not created equally, though, so travelers should do a little online research before trying to redeem their points. Checking with websites devoted to helping travelers get the most value for their travel points can really pay off in the long-run.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Flying first class can be a luxurious, satisfying experience, but only if you&#38;#39;re not spending the flight time worrying about how much you spent on those coveted first class tickets. For the best first class airfare deals, enlist the help of a service like IFlyFirstClass, and check in from time to time for more tips on finding terrific first class deals.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Searching for business class cheap one way fairs?&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Competition in the luxury travel industry is sharpening, leading to more opulent business class services and cutting-edge amenities. As the number of business class seats expand and competition deepens, travelers benefit with more amazing flight options and better business class deals. But, finding those deals takes skill and know-how, and who better to provide those tips than the discount premium travel service IFlyFirstClass?&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    TO help would-be jet-setters find the best discount business class fares, IFlyFirstClass offers these tips of the trade:&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    1. Choose timing wisely. Flights on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Saturdays are generally less busy so they are more likely to offer better pricing. Travelers looking for business class bargains should also be willing to fly at any time of day or night in order to get the best prices. And, selecting seasons that are less popular for business travelers may also pay off. For example, many European businesses take a holiday during the month of August. As a result, there may be excess available business class tickets to European destinations during that time, leading to better discounts.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    2. Choose regional airports. In the competitive air travel business, smaller airports edge out their rivals by providing lower costs to airlines that sometimes trickle down as lower costs for travelers. If you&#38;#39;re flying out of San Francisco, for instance, check rates on the same airlines flying out of nearby airports like San Jose and Oakland.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    3. Rack up the points. Sign up for airline clubs that reward members for flying with the company to increase your chances of being upgraded to business class. And, be sure to check out some of the top travel rewards credit cards that provide consumers with points. These points can be redeemed for a variety of travel products, including business class seats. Just keep in mind that these credit cards are only a good deal if you are able to pay off the balance each month, they transfer points to airlines you want to use and the restrictions are not too limiting. Also, beware of costly annual fees and potential points transfer fees.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;4. Become an expert on premium travel. A variety of websites provide information on how to redeem points for maximum value and how to find better discounted business class flights. FlyerTalk teems with travel experts and site posters who have a wealth of knowledge in how to work the fare and points systems to your advantage.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    5. Use the experts. By far, the easiest way to find cheap business class fares is to use the services of a travel agency that specializes in discounted business class seats. They work day-in and day-out with the airlines so they are always on top of the latest business class deals and fare reductions. Best of all, using a service like IFlyFirstClass&#38;#160;simply takes a quick phone call or website nudge to get the ball rolling on your next discounted business class flight.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;

Whether travelers want to jet on cheap first class flights to snow-filled resorts or plan to take a discounted business class fare to escape the chill of winter, here are some of the top international winter destinations.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Those in the winter-loving camp savor the sights, sounds, aromas and spirit of the season, flocking to some of Europe&#38;#39;s most beloved Christmas markets and ski resorts. Beautiful Stuttgart, Germany, is the place to go for an appealing traditional Christmas market. The market dates back to 1692 and features hundreds of illuminations, exhilarating concerts and nearly 300 craft and food stalls with plenty of traditional Black Forest delights.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Also a Christmastime favorite, Salzburg, Austria, is famous as the birthplace of &#38;quot;Silent Night.&#38;quot; Visitors revel in the city&#38;#39;s enticing and varied Christmas markets. And, they delight in the moving, once-in-a-lifetime experience found at the Obendorf chapel site that started it all.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    For skiing, ice skating and other winter activities, La Plagne, France, is the top destination. Named the world&#38;#39;s most popular ski destination in the 2014 International Report on Snow and Mountain Tourism, La Plagne hosts about 2.5 million visitors each year. The resort town offers everything from downhill skiing and spa services to bobsledding and ice climbing. Tucked into the captivating French Alps, La Plagne and its brethren Alpine ski resorts attract 45 percent of all ski travelers, making the entire region a flurry of winter activity.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Ottowa, Canada, embraces a variety of other treasured winter traditions, including its Winterlude festival that is one of the largest in the world. Ice sculptures, a 4.8-mile ice &#38;quot;skateway&#38;quot; and lively outdoor concerts are just a few of the city&#38;#39;s thrilling winter offerings.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Those who want a little surf and sun for their winter holiday head for more tropical destinations aboard luxuriously discounted first class flights and business class fares. Traditionally, sun lovers have flocked to Thailand&#38;#39;s warm beaches and turquoise waves, but Vietnam&#38;#39;s Phu Quoc Island is quickly becoming a favorite. Reef diving, secluded beaches and gorgeous waterfalls are the perfect antidote to chilly North American climates.&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;Mexico&#38;#39;s Cabo San Lucas continues to attract sun-seekers looking for a rousing beach vacation. Sun-seekers adore Cabo in the winter for its fascinating scuba diving, chic nightlife, sleek resorts and plush golf courses. In winter, the warm climate provides days in the high 70s and low 80s, comfortable evenings in the mid-50s to 60s and the perfect conditions for a warm, fun-filled holiday.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Other sun-seekers prefer the colorful islands of the Caribbean for their winter escape from workplace responsibilities. Since hurricane season traditionally ends November 30, winter is the ideal time to experience all of the Caribbean&#38;#39;s uniquely captivating sights and flavors. Whether flying in affordable &#60;strong&#62;first class&#60;/strong&#62; to Puerto Rico or luxuriating in spacious business class seats en route to St. Martin, the Caribbean islands are the ideal vacation. There, visitors can explore history and culture, relax on the beach, scuba dive, swim and enjoy the balmy weather and tropical landscapes.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    From sunshine and palm trees to snow-capped mountains and pines, the world offers a bounty of beautiful winter escapes. And, there&#38;#39;s no better way to begin a brilliant winter interlude than with a&#60;strong&#62; luxuriously cheap first class flight&#60;/strong&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Knowing when to book a cheap business first class fares&#38;#160;to get the best deals in business class can be tricky. Recent news reports tout that the ideal time to find cheap business class flights and first class deals is 54 days in advance, but that oversimplification may lead bargain hunters down the wrong path. Travelers searching for the biggest savings need a bit more knowledge and savvy to really score the best deals, particularly when it comes to booking business class to Europe and other international destinations.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    First, some general guidelines will help in the hunt for cheap first class tickets and business class flights. For international destinations, most cheap business class and first class airfare deals are found about 60 days before the intended flight. But, there are some caveats with that rule: watch out for big holidays, peak seasons and special global events like the Olympics and the World Cup that place high demand on tickets. After all, the higher the demand, the higher the price airlines place on fares.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Business class specials and cheap first class prices also vary by continent, complicating the search. For instance, business class to Europe usually offers the best flight deals about 151 days before the scheduled flight. As a result, travel aboard business class to London and first class to Frankfurt generally should be booked more than five months in advance. But, that rule is thrown out the door when high-demand summer travel is concerned. A recent study of prices found that summer flights to Europe should be booked 319 days in advance, nearly a full year prior to travel.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;Travelers shouldn&#38;#39;t despair, though, because those same market forces can work to their advantage when demand is low. For example, first class specials and cheap business class flights to Asia are more readily available 129 days in advance. But, some Asian countries like South Korea experience their off-peak season from January to April, so first class to Seoul may be a steal just two months in advance. Similarly, globetrotters flying business class to Hong Kong in winter months may find terrific deals as long as they avoid the late-January/early Feburary festival and holiday season.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    It&#38;#39;s also helpful to know when the demand is great for economy and coach seats but low for premium seats. That can be the case during some of the biggest summer travel months in Europe when pleasure travelers flock to coach, not knowing that cheap business class prices may offer more value.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    In the end, finding the most deeply discounted business class seats and first class fares takes a fair amount of skill, knowledge and ingenuity. Unfortunately, many travelers don&#38;#8217;t have the luxury of extended lead times or the in-depth knowledge of a country&#38;#8217;s holidays, special events and peak seasons to find the most discounted business class tickets and cheap first class flights. That&#38;#39;s where discount premium travel experts come in handy. Services like IFlyFirstClass&#38;#160;specialize in finding the most inexpensive first and business class flights, drawing on years of experience to know where, when and how to find bargain premium flights. That gives travelers the advantage of cheap premium flights without the hassle of picking just the right time to book a flight abroad.&#60;/p&#62;

Already, announcements of new mega-luscious first class apartment suites and dozens of other sumptuous first and business class amenities were the talk of the industry. And now, a recent report by aviation data company OAG reveals a whopping 34 percent increase in the number of first class seats on 2014 flights. </summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;One Way Airline Tickets&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The news just gets better for savvy travelers looking for cheap first class tickets and discounted business class flights. Already, announcements of new mega-luscious first class apartment suites and dozens of other sumptuous first and business class amenities were the talk of the industry. And now, a recent report by aviation data company OAG reveals a whopping 34 percent increase in the number of first class seats on 2014 flights.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    This greater number of seats will eventually translate into greater availability and more first class airfare deals on seats that remain unsold. Best deals on one way tickets.&#38;#160;This puts to bed the notion that luxury travel was dying, an argument that seemed to be supported when American Airlines announced it was eliminating first class seating on its long-haul Boeing 777-200s.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Unsurprisingly, the greatest first class seat growth is found on Middle Eastern and Chinese aircraft that serve the regions&#38;#39; growing economies. In 2005, 8.6 million first class seats were available in Asia. In 2014, that number jumped to 26.7 million. Air China added 63 percent to its first class seating between 2009 and 2014, and China Eastern gained a full 123 percent over the same time period. And while many of these luxurious seats come with equally sumptuous price tags, their proliferation ultimately means cheap first class prices for those who know where to look for the bargains. So, travelers who are searching for discounted first class to Seoul or cheap first class seats to Hong Kong may have a better chance of finding a bargain in today&#38;#39;s market.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Even in markets like Europe and the Americas where first class capacity is down, the prospects for cheap business class flights remain strong. For instance, although American Airlines is eliminating its first class seating on international flights, it&#38;#39;s doing so to increase the number of business class seats that lie fully flat. As a result, flyers can expect more luxury, whether they&#38;#39;re flying business class to London, business class to Hong Kong or business class to Europe. Even better, when a number of these business class flights aren&#38;#39;t filled to capacity, the opportunities for cheap business class tickets and system-wide business class specials abound.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;In spite of all these positive developments in both first and business class flights, the secret to scoring the best deals business class and first class have to offer remains complicated. Knowing when and where to find first class specials and discounted business class tickets takes extensive knowledge of capacity and travel trends, airline practices and seasonal demand. That&#38;#39;s why it&#38;#39;s often easier and more profitable to seek the help of a company like IFlyFirstClass that specializes in accessing first class deals and cheap business class prices. These discount premium travel experts give travelers the very best deals available, even on traditionally pricey one way business class fares and last minute flights.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    However travelers choose to book their premium flights, the recent study by OAG points to an expansion of luxurious in-air offerings and greater opportunity to enjoy first class and business class amenities.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;br /&#62;
    When choosing a departure airport, travelers might want to consult Businessweek&#38;#39;s recently released Airport Frustration Index. The index lists North America&#38;#39;s most and least irritating airports based on the feedback from 3,000 frequent fliers, on-time performance statistics and other data. Unfortunately, some of the airports that are popular East Coast departure points for business class to London, first class to Seoul and business class to Hong Kong are some of the continent&#38;#39;s most frustrating airports. The top offender was New York&#38;#39;s LaGuardia Airport, followed by Newark Liberty International, Washington Dulles, Chicago O&#38;#39;Hare and New York&#38;#39;s JFK.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Some of the middle-ranking airports received mixed reviews, offering some good points like quick drive times to the airport along with some downsides like long security lines. As alternatives to the most frustrating airports, these might offer some advantages but they may not be your first choice if you&#38;#39;re looking beyond only cheap first class fares or cheap business class prices. Some of these moderately frustrating airports include San Francisco, Denver, Charlotte Douglas, Boston Logan and Ronald Reagan National.&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;Luckily, the news isn&#38;#39;t all bad. Several popular airports achieved acclaim as the least frustrating airports, and they often provide&#38;#160;first class specials&#38;#160;and cheap&#38;#160;business class flights. Vancouver International topped this least frustrating list, followed by Portland Oregon, Austin-Bergstrom, Calgary, Phoneix, Tampa and Seattle-Tacoma. They all rated well with restroom cleanliness, efficient security lines and ample shopping. With this information in mind, savvy fliers who want first class airfare deals, business class to Asia or reduced business class to Europe might want to consider some of these less frustrating airports.&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;A journey to Middle Earth, or at least the movie version of it, whisks travelers away to the gorgeous scenery and welcoming culture of New Zealand. For savvy travelers who are looking to begin and end their excursion to New Zealand in the lap of luxury, there are plenty of cheap business class flights and first class airfare deals to sweeten the trip.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    The Journey, Part One&#60;br /&#62;
    After you&#38;#39;ve scored the best deals business class has to offer or you&#38;#39;ve found dreamy cheap first class fares, book your trip to start at Aukland Airport. Aukland&#38;#39;s location on the North Island is the perfect jumping off point for a variety of adventures, including those that involve the &#38;quot;Hobbit.&#38;quot; While driving to some of the sites allows you to experience more the country&#38;#39;s culture and attractions, some of the area&#38;#39;s tours are able to access privately-operated locations. Whether you choose to go it alone or join a group, &#38;quot;Hobbit&#38;quot; fans are sure to be captivated.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Travel first to PioPio, about two and-a-half hours south of Aukland. Its massive limestone rocks and scenery make up the Denize Bluffs and were the site of Trollshaw forest and Staddle Farm. It is here that Gandalf gave the sword &#38;quot;Sting&#38;quot; to Bilbao and the Orcs and Wargs attacked.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Once you&#38;#39;ve relished all of the campfire and troll scene locales, continue on to Matamata. There, you&#38;#39;ll find the life-sized hobbit holes of Hobbiton, see Bilbo Baggins&#38;#39; home and dine at the Green Dragon Inn. From Matamata, travelers may continue driving south or return to Aukland to take a luxuriously cheap first class flight or discounted business class fare to bustling Wellington.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    The Journey, Part Two&#60;br /&#62;
    Wellington&#38;#39;s airport is one of the best airports in Australasia and features a 43-foot long Gollum sculpture suspended from the airport rafters. Wellington itself is home to the &#38;quot;Hobbit&#38;#39;s&#38;quot; soundstage and lot at Stone Street Studios.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;From Wellington, it&#38;#39;s a four-hour trip north to Turoa, the entrance to The Lonely Mountain site. On one side of the mountainous area is Hidden Bay, used for the scene where Gollum scampered along the river chasing fish. The other side is home to Tongariro Park&#38;#39;s volcanic region, used for Mordor&#38;#39;s home and Mt. Doom.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    The Journey, Part Three&#60;br /&#62;
    Then, it&#38;#39;s back to Wellington for more comfortable and cheap business class flights to the South Island. While on the South Island, check out the Pelorus River, the setting of the Misty Mountains and the turquoise Lake Pukaki&#38;#39;s setting as Laketown.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Of course, there are dozens of other sites throughout the country that served as backdrops and scenes from the &#38;quot;Hobbit&#38;quot; trilogy, and saving money with cheap first class tickets or discounted business class tickets can help you explore them all. If searching for bargain premium travel is proving to be your own personal drama, use a service like IFlyFirstClass that specializes in finding business class specials and first class deals that save you hundreds of dollars. They&#38;#39;ll even unearth deals on one way business class fares if you decide to explore beautiful New Zealand for an extended period of time.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;h3&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/h3&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Majestic, poignant and historic, much of the world&#38;#39;s history is tied up in some of its most beloved clock towers. Travelers can skip the predictable itineraries by creating an unusual journey exploring the world&#38;#39;s massive clocks and the architectural, technological and cultural triumphs they represent. Five clock towers are our favorites, some for their history, some for their grand scale and some for the message of hope and peace they protray. Travelers can even fly to these clock towers in style with cheap business class flights and first class specials.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Big Ben, London&#60;br /&#62;
    Gorgeous Elizabeth Tower is home to the legendary 13-ton Big Ben bell and Great Westminster Clock, the world&#38;#39;s largest four-faced chiming clock. The 1859 neo-Gothic clock features dials that are nearly 30 feet in diameter and two-foot tall numerals. During World War II blitzes of London, the bell continued chiming, reassuring the community that London still stood. Summer is high season in London, so travelers will more easily find cheap first class tickets and business class to London in the fall, winter and spring.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Rathaus-Glockenspiel, Munich&#60;br /&#62;
    Housed in the neo-Gothic New Town Hall, the Glockenspiel is located in the balcony of the tower. Chiming at 11 o&#38;#39;clock each day, the two-tier display reenacts some of the city&#38;#39;s cultural touchpoints in a 12-minute spectacle with finely carved figurines: the marriage of Duke Wilhelm V, its celebratory joust and the cooper&#38;#39;s dance, Sch&#38;auml;fflertanz. As with most European destinations, summer is peak season in Munich, so cheap first class prices and the best deals on business class to Europe are found from March to May and September to November.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Makkah Royal Clock Tower, Mecca&#60;br /&#62;
    The world&#38;#39;s largest clock face is located in the heart of Saudi Arabia&#38;#39;s Mecca. At 1,833 feet tall, it&#38;#39;s also the tallest clock tower on earth. An observation deck at the clock&#38;#39;s base provides a unique viewing experience, and the building itself houses a hotel, residences, an Islamic museum and a lunar observatory. The best time to find cheap business class tickets and first class deals to the Holy City are from November to January.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;Twin Clock Tower, Seoul&#60;br /&#62;
    A powerful element of the War Memorial of Korea, the Twin Clock Tower isn&#38;#39;t the traditional tower. Depicting the never-ending struggle between North and South, the two clocks are held by statues of young girls. One clock displays the day and hour that war began between South Korea and North Korea. The other clock is blank, awaiting the time it can display the day and hour Korea is reunified. Low and shoulder seasons for Seoul are May to June and September to December, so those are terrific times to find cheap business class to Asia and especially cheap first class to Seoul&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong&#60;br /&#62;
    Standing 144 feet tall, Hong Kong&#38;#39;s Clock Tower is a local favorite and an enticing attraction to visitors. Now resting at the base of Salisbury Road next to the ferry pier, the clock tower was a symbol of hope and welcome to millions of Chinese immigrants. It has operated nearly ceaselessly since its creation in 1921, but it did not run during the World War II Japanese occupation of Hong Kong. Discounted business class to Hong Kong and first class airfare deals are abundant year-round, but are most easily found in winter and summer.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    There is hope for travelers who would rather spend their time enjoying their destinations than searching for discounted business class tickets and first class deals. IFlyFirstClass specializes in offering the best deals business class has to offer as well as cheap first class fares to dozens of international destinations and clock towers.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;br /&#62;
    Tokyo: Mysteries of the East&#60;br /&#62;

</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;Hi Seoul Festival&#60;br /&#62;

Autumn months in Seoul are generally good travel times, since summer&#38;#39;s heat and humidity have passed.

Whether you change your mode of transportation, your destination or your activities, there are dozens of ways to make this year&#39;s ski holiday memorable. </summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;p&#62;Tired of the usual ski vacation that takes you to the same posh ski resort year after year? Shake things up this winter with a ski excursion that is a little more interesting, a little more adventurous and a lot more luxurious. Whether you change your mode of transportation, your destination or your activities, there are dozens of ways to make this year&#38;#39;s ski holiday memorable.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    One change that can add a little zip to your schussing is to travel aboard the pampering comfort of first and business class flights. With increasing competition for the premium travel market, cheap business class flights and first class specials are easier than ever to find, so it&#38;#39;s a snap to fly to your destination in luxury.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Alternatively, you can also jazz up typical ski vacations with picturesque, restful journeys on Europe&#38;#39;s trains. Even if you can&#38;#39;t miss a winter holiday at chic Courcheval 1850, you can still create a unique experience by traveling in peaceful convenience on the train. Winter is the perfect time to find cheap first class and business class to London, so fly there instead of choosing business class to Europe&#38;#39;s closer cities like Geneva and Lyon. Your family can explore London without the usual crowds, then you can all enjoy an unforgettable train ride to France&#38;#39;s Three Valleys.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    For an even more unusual trek, skip the European ski holiday and head to the East. It&#38;#39;s relatively easy to find cheap first class tickets and cheap business class to Asia in the winter so you can make the long flight in spacious style. For the ultimate luxury, fly first class to Seoul or snag some discounted business class tickets to the nation&#38;#39;s capital. With at least five ski resorts less than an hour away, you can snowboard at Bears Town in Pocheon, enjoy exclusive lifts at Namyangju-si&#38;#39;s Star Hill or relish night skiing at Yangji Pine Resort.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Similarly, abundant first class deals and cheap business class tickets make the journey to China and nearby regions peaceful and pleasant. Sometimes, the less-direct route makes for a more exciting, budget-friendly journey. Business class to Hong Kong, for example, is 20-40 percent cheaper in late winter than it is in summer. And, if you use a service like IFlyFirstClass that specializes in discounted business class fares and cheap first class prices, you&#38;#39;ll save even more. That savings frees up plenty of cash to spend at Hong Kong&#38;#39;s acclaimed restaurants and night clubs and leaves money to spare for jaunts to South Korean and Chinese ski slopes.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;You can keep your skis busy year-round, too, with New Zealand&#38;#39;s cozy ski resorts operating from June to October. Kiwi resorts are smaller but no less exciting than traditional Alpine settings, creating a more intimate experience. New Zealand&#38;#39;s act-at-your-own-risk attitude and thrill-seeking reputation also means that more daring ski adventures like heli-skiing are bountiful. The best deals business class has to offer often include discounted business class tickets to Wellington. First class airfare deals to Aukland are also attractive. Both destinations take you to the North Island and resorts like Whakapapa, but they also give you quick access to the South Island&#38;#39;s legendary Treble Cone.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Whether you opt for the East, the South Pacific or Europe for your next ski adventure, be sure to create a restful travel experience with cheap business class flights and first class deals. You&#38;#39;ll be catered to in the air and at the airport so you can reserve all your energy for the slopes.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;br /&#62;
    Adelaide&#38;#39;s reputation as a low-key, unassuming city leads many travelers to make the mistake of overlooking Adelaide&#38;#39;s many delights. The city is actually very cosmopolitan, preferring to show its style with a European sensibility of quality, understated elegance and openness. Charming Adelaide differentiates itself from other metropolitan areas with beautifully preserved buildings, ample green spaces and inviting public landscapes. If you are already interested in traveling to&#38;#160;Adelaide - get your discounted business class flights and save.&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;The pleasing architecture and city design is just part of Adelaide&#38;#39;s considerable appeal, and with a large number of local multi-millionaires, Adelaide sports plenty of attractions for high-end travelers. Here are some of our favorites:&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Dine in Style, Inside and Outside the City&#60;br /&#62;
    A town that produces the refined, decadent flavor of Haigh&#38;#39;s Chocolates is sure to have other edible delights just waiting to be sampled, and Adelaide&#38;#39;s food scene does not disappoint. Many of the city&#38;#39;s best-known restaurants line colorful Gouger Street, from Concubine Chinese Restaurant and the Indian fare of The Thali Room to the seafood-rich Loft Oyster and Wine Bar. Outlying areas are equally worth exploring, including the swanky suburb of Belair where Windy Point&#38;#39;s dishes earn many accolades. Also just outside the city, Magill Estate Restaurant&#38;#39;s incredible views of the foothills and surrounding vineyards complement its contemporary and fresh cuisine and extensive Penfolds wines.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;Enjoying a Luxury Itinerary and&#38;#160;the most affrodable business class flight&#60;br /&#62;
    Adelaide is surrounded by incredible landscapes. These features provide enticing recreation and sports that are just as perfect for adventure-seekers as they are for more relaxed travelers. Kayaking the Torren River and picturesque mangroves, sailing the bay and touring the Barossa Valley wineries can be as luxurious or as low-key as you want. If you plan to visit the region often or have business contacts in the area, renting an Adelaide Oval corporate suite for the season is a great way to make a big splash. Suite-holders enjoy a year&#38;#39;s worth of cricket and football games and have preferential booking for the venue&#38;#39;s rugby games, Test Matches and concerts as well as access to the Audi Stadium Club. The Art Gallery of South Australia, the Botanic Gardens, the South Australia Museum and the State Theatre Company are also worth a visit and give visitors an opportunity to connect with like-minded travelers and locals.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Living in Luxury, flying last minute business class to Adelaide&#60;br /&#62;
    Spectacular river views and sumptuous rooms are the hallmark of the InterContinental Adelaide. The hotel is one of Adelaide&#38;#39;s few towers, offering executive suites and floors, private limousines and secretarial services to guests. Chic Clarion Hotel Soho dazzles with a roof-top pool, Soho Spa and fine dining. Just outside of the city in the Adelaide Hills, the Thorngrove Manor Hotel is full of Old World charm and is a unique way to luxuriously experience South Australia. For breathtaking ocean scenery, nearby Kangaroo Island&#38;#39;s Southern Ocean Lodge blends lush guest suites and personalized service with views of the bay and grazing kangaroos.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Picking Up a Few Trinkets Along the Way&#60;br /&#62;
    Adelaide is much more oriented to its festivals, recreation and cultural treasures than its retail establishments, but its posh shopping scene continues to grow. While in town, don&#38;#39;t miss a visit to Tiffany &#38;amp; Co., Oroton, Colette Hayman, David Jones and Max Mara along the welcoming North Terrace.&#60;/p&#62;

    Getting to Asia, Oceania, Europe and the Caribbean amid the luxury of first class air is just the beginning of a glamorous trip abroad. With 71 percent of the earth covered in water, there are thousands of irresistible beaches around the world. Below are the first five of our top 10 favorite beach regions around the globe.
</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
    Philippines&#60;br /&#62;
    Sporting breathtaking marble cliffs and seas that are an impossibly brilliant shade of blue, El Nido is the pinnacle of Philippine beaches. The El Nido area alone has 50 beaches, and its larger Palawan region has even more. Its beach sand is powder-fine and blindingly white, just perfect for cushioning tender feet. Legendary waterfalls and prehistoric caves give the area an added mystique and are perfect for an afternoon of exploring.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;

    &#60;br /&#62;
    Queensland, Australia&#60;br /&#62;
    With more than 10,000 beaches in Australia, there&#38;#8217;s a beach for nearly every individual taste. For a popular Christmas Day beach trip close to Sydney, locals and visitors head to Bondi. For incredible surfing, conventional wisdom points to the North Coast&#38;#8217;s Angourie. Queensland, in particular, is home to a wide range of stunning beaches, from Surfers Paradise to Mission Beach. When it comes to stunning ecology and terrific activities, though, it&#38;#8217;s tough to beat the captivating expanse of beaches around Fraser Island. The island&#38;#8217;s eastern 75-Mile Beach is a favorite for all-terrain vehicles, and and it is actually a registered highway. Five-star resorts aren&#38;#8217;t abundant on Fraser, so visitors might consider staying nearby or much farther north among the Whitsunday Islands.&#60;br /&#62;

    Malaysia&#60;br /&#62;
    Once a hideaway for pirates, Malaysia&#38;#8217;s Langkawi is one of the region&#38;#8217;s most treasured beach areas. One of the best ways to experience the destination is to take advantage of the many cheap deals to Singapore, then hop a regional jet or cruise ship to the Lankgawi archipelago of 99 islands. Its beaches offer soft, super-fine sand, coconut-laden palm trees and deep azure seawater, and its main island is the place to go for duty-free chocolate and alcohol.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Luxury Hotels: Four Seasons Lankgawi, The Adaman, The Datai, The Westin Lankgawi&#60;br /&#62;

    Cape Town, South Africa&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    With iconic Table Mountain as its backdrop, Cape Town is stunning, and its beaches are equally magnificent. Visitors can sunbathe and hobnob with Cape Town society at Clifton 4th Beach or enjoy views of the 12 Apostles and catch a game of beach volleyball at Camps Bay beach. For warmer Indian Ocean water and captivating penguin-watching, travelers head to Boulders Beach. Llandudno is a well-kept local secret, beloved by residents for its surfing and thrilling sunsets.&#60;br /&#62;

    Relaxing on a sandy beach, sipping cocktails and enjoying gorgeous ocean views is a popular dream vacation for many travelers, and few beach getaways are as pleasurable as those found in exciting exotic destinations. This continuation of our series on top international beaches takes travelers from the ancient cliffs of Greece to the warm embrace of French Polynesia. Most of these top destinations are easily accessed, especially with the proliferation of cheap business class and first class flights available today.</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;div&#62;Thailand&#60;/div&#62;

    &#60;div&#62;With some of the most iconic tropical beaches, Thailand is a favorite of travelers looking to blend exotic adventures with lush scenery and even lusher resorts. While Thailand&#38;#8217;s Phuket on the Andaman Coast is frequented by many travelers, the region still has a few hidden gems. These treasures include Nai Harn Beach, where forests of trees meet the shoreline and Ao Sane, where snorkeling is supreme. Phi Phi is another terrific choice for its majestic limestone rock formations and inviting turquoise water.&#60;/div&#62;

    &#60;div&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/div&#62;

    &#60;div&#62;Luxury Hotels: Banyan Tree Samui, Four Seasons Samui, Amanpuri, Anantara Phuket, Banyan Tree Phuket.&#38;#160;&#60;/div&#62;

    &#60;div&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/div&#62;

    &#60;div&#62;Greece&#60;/div&#62;

    &#60;div&#62;Just as Odysseus found himself lucky to find Corfu, travelers will relish all of the Greek island&#38;#8217;s abundant delights. Sensational cliffs are the backdrop of Corfu&#38;#8217;s beaches, sprinkled with wildflower fields and nearby olive and citrus groves. Glyfada Beach welcomes visitors to broad, golden beaches and dramatic views. Swim out to the small island rocks for a look back at the island and idyllic cliff diving spots, or relax in one of the beach&#38;#8217;s charming tavernas. For au naturel sunbathing, head to nearby Miriotissa. There are usually quite a few first and business class deals to Europe that can transport travelers to the area in style.&#60;/div&#62;

    &#60;div&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/div&#62;

    &#60;div&#62;Luxury Hotels: Grecotel Corfu Imperial, Marbella Beach Corfu&#60;/div&#62;

    &#60;div&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/div&#62;

    &#60;div&#62;French Polynesia&#60;/div&#62;

    &#60;div&#62;Gracious locals, legendary beaches and exquisite scenery greet visitors to French Polynesia&#38;#8217;s Bora Bora island. Perched among the island&#38;#8217;s inviting lagoons are stilted villas, which serve as the perfect home base for bountiful activities. Matira is one of the island&#38;#8217;s most famous beaches, but there are plenty of options around the island.&#38;#160;&#60;/div&#62;

    &#60;div&#62;Maldives&#60;/div&#62;

    &#60;div&#62;Warm, soft water and fascinating coral reefs are two of the top draws of The Maldives archipelago. While snorkeling and scuba diving along the reefs is a popular way to enjoy the colorful tropical fish, it&#38;#8217;s equally delightful to just sit back and enjoy the picturesque palm trees, brilliant sunsets and pampering resort services. The islands of the archipelago nation are known for their sumptuous resorts, so there are plenty of options for travelers.&#60;/div&#62;

    &#60;div&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/div&#62;

    &#60;div&#62;Luxury Hotels: Four Seasons (Landaa Giraavaru and Kuda Huraa), One&#38;amp;Only Reethi Rah, Shangri-La Villingili&#60;/div&#62;

    &#60;div&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/div&#62;

    &#60;div&#62;Seychelles&#60;/div&#62;

    &#60;div&#62;A trip to this Indian Ocean group of islands is the ultimate dream beach vacation. Its La Digue island boasts one of the world&#38;#8217;s most photographed beaches, famous for its pink sand, scenic palm trees and appealing rock formations. With 115 islands in the Seychelles, though, there are dozens of other beaches to visit, each with its own pleasures. Savvy travelers will look for discounted flights in first or business class so that they can spend a longer holiday in one of the area&#38;#8217;s many luxury resorts.&#60;/div&#62;

    &#60;div&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/div&#62;

Traveling with cheap first class airfare, notifying credit card companies and banks of your destination and prepping your mobile phone will assure you have a worry-free vacation.</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;p&#62;The anticipation of a delightful trip to the Continent is just part of the pleasure of travel, especially if you&#38;#39;re flying in luxury thanks to cheap business class tickets to Europe. Before you get swept away with dreams of a flawless holiday, though, you should spend some time taking care of a few details. Planning ahead will ultimately make your trip more enjoyable, ensuring that you, your money and your plans are safe while abroad.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Money, Money, Money&#60;br /&#62;
    Notify your credit card companies that you&#38;#39;ll be traveling to specific countries in Europe and double-check that you understand any fees you may be charged for using your cards abroad. While on the call, request a chip-and-pin or smart card. Most European automated payment machines like those found at toll roads, train ticket booths and parking garages require chip-and-pin cards. Be sure to safeguard your cards in a money belt or similar product and carry your cash in a couple of different locations to avoid pick-pocket woes.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Getting Around Town&#60;br /&#62;
    If you plan to rent a car, you&#38;#39;ll need your U.S.-issued driver&#38;#39;s license. Some countries also require an International Driving Permit, so check the rules for driving in your specific destinations. Similarly, if you plan to take taxis or private cars in a certain town, check the local requirements for distance limits, payment options and rates.&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;In London, only the iconic black cars are licensed taxis, and they are available for hire only if their yellow &#38;quot;taxi&#38;quot; signs are lit.&#38;#160;Some European countries have experienced protests surrounding the use of Uber, so it&#38;#39;s always a good idea to find out which Uber services are allowed in your destination country. Knowing how to navigate local taxi services and public transportation before you disembark from your first class flights helps keep your journey hassle-free.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
    Smart Travel with Smart Phones&#60;br /&#62;
    Your smart phone or iPad can be an invaluable asset while you&#38;#39;re traveling through Europe, but you don&#38;#39;t want to be surprised with an astronomical wireless bill when you get home. To avoid any unexpected expenses, call your smart phone company before you leave and clarify potential charges. Also, ask the company to unlock your phone for international use. If your phone company offers an international calling plan, sign up for it. If not, purchase a SIM card at a mobile phone store in your destination country, but do not do this at the arrival airport. The local European SIM card will allow you to communicate with other members of your traveling party and local hotels, restaurants and tour companies throughout your stay. You&#38;#8217;ll also be able to use the device to book last minute flights for spur-of-the-moment side trips.&#60;/p&#62;

It also includes understanding how current international financial events affect exchange rates, knowing how to cheaply convert currency, preparing for international credit card transactions and finding apps to help track expenses.
</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;p&#62;No one wants to spend more than necessary on a trip abroad, even if they&#38;#8217;re traveling in the lap of luxury aboard first class. Travelers spend countless hours searching for discount first class flights to Singapore, London and other exciting destinations, but they often don&#38;#8217;t realize that they should spend an equal amount of time planning ways to make the most of their money while traveling.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Dollars, Euros and Pounds, Oh My!&#60;br /&#62;
    Recent financial troubles in Greece, Spain, Portugal, Latvia and Ireland can make it difficult to know how to handle money while in Europe. Add in the complication of knowing which European countries have retained their own currencies, and you have even more confusion. The temptation for many U.S. travelers will be to simply use dollars to avoid the hassle and fees of converting money to euros and pounds, but that&#38;#39;s a money-losing strategy. Where possible, travelers should convert cash to local currency at postal banks where exchange fees are less onerous.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Before the trip, travelers should download an easy-to-use currency conversion app on their smart phones. Even though travelers aren&#38;#8217;t paying in dollars, it&#38;#8217;s important to know the cost of purchases, hotel stays, restaurant bills and train tickets. The conversion apps give travelers an easy way to understand real costs so they can make smart purchase decisions. Maps and international flight booking apps are also helpful so travelers can navigate their destinations or buy last minute business class flights for fun side trips.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;Give Yourself Some Credit&#60;br /&#62;
    Using credit cards in foreign countries may be easiest, but it&#38;#8217;s important to check ahead of time what types of credit cards are accepted in a particular country. In some Asian countries, for instance, credit cards may be difficult to use so cash is the way to go.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Most European countries use credit cards that require PIN input along with the card. To avoid complications, travelers should call their credit card companies and request actual chip-and-pin cards that meet the European standard.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    When setting up the chip-and-pin card or when making purchases with credit cards, travelers may be asked whether they want to be charged in dollars or euros. It&#38;#8217;s nearly always best to ask the company to charge the purchase in the local European currency. There&#38;#8217;s often a fee or mark-up for the store to convert the charges to U.S. dollars, and that&#38;#8217;s just wasted money for travelers who want to control their costs.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    With a little research and planning, it&#38;#8217;s relatively easy for travelers to make the most of their travel budgets. Whether they&#38;#8217;re whisking a partner away for a special holiday on cheap first class seats to Jakarta or simply traveling for business, there&#38;#8217;s always savings to be found.&#60;/p&#62;

In fact, worrying about how you&#38;#8217;ll be getting around your destination city may be one of the biggest sources of travel anxiety. You can ease your mind, though, by learning about your destination city and using a few of our helpful tips.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Taxis&#60;br /&#62;
    Each country and city has its own rules about licensing taxis, so it&#38;#8217;s always best to research the destination city&#38;#8217;s taxi system before leaving home. While in the destination city, you can protect yourself by using only licensed taxis, usually identified with a prominent company name. London cabs are always black, making it extra-easy to spot a taxi there. To find a safe taxi, use a downloaded taxi-scheduling app on your smart phone or go to a well-marked taxi stand. For your safety, do not flag down or use a taxi that is not prominently identified with signs and a phone number.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    In some Asian cities, it&#38;#8217;s popular for tourists to hop on the back of an unofficial taxi motorcycle for cheap transport around town. While this is definitely an inexpensive way to get around, it can be dangerous given the lack of helmets and unauthorized status of the driver.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    To Uber or Not to Uber?&#60;br /&#62;
    Some European cities have protested the presence of Uber, and that can be frightening for passengers who are caught in the middle of an aggressive protest. Other cities only allow certain types of Uber services to be used. In Paris, for instance, it&#38;#8217;s legal to use UberX, but UberPop is not allowed. Always check Uber&#38;#8217;s status in your destination city before you leave home if you plan to use the service.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Car rentals&#60;br /&#62;
    For travelers who want their own wheels, renting a car in most major European and Asian cities is relatively easy, if you know the requirements ahead of time. Most international airports offer car rental counters that are easily accessed after you disembark from your discounted first class flights.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;If you&#38;#8217;ve researched the requirements and still want to rent a car, be prepared for encountering toll roads. Some European countries like Belarus use electronic pay systems while others like Croatia ask drivers to pay at the end of the toll road. A little pre-travel research provides helpful information about your destination country&#38;#8217;s toll road system.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    It&#38;#8217;s also helpful to download driving maps on a smart device before leaving home so you can avoid purchasing the GPS rental along with the rental car.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    In some Asian countries like Bali, travelers prefer to rent motorcycles instead of cars. In addition to less official paperwork, motorcycles are an often-easier way to travel through the region. If you plan on renting a motorcycle, make sure you understand the rules of the road, if there are any, and double-check that you&#38;#8217;ll have access to a helmet.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Trains&#60;br /&#62;
    Europe and some Asian countries like Japan are known for their stellar train systems. Rail passes often provide a more cost-effective way to use train service. If you&#38;#8217;re traveling to Europe or Japan, be sure to buy your rail pass before you leave home, and you may even want to book your seat in advance.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    In Asia, train quality varies widely. Japan has clean, well-kept commuter and high-speed bullet trains, while Malaysian and Vietnamese trains offer trains of different classes. Overnight trains along some Malaysian Peninsula and Vietnamese routes are popular and comfortable, but lack food service and American-style toilets.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Taking the time to research ground transport options before you leave for your trip can save you money and ensure that you have a safe, enjoyable journey. After all, it would be a shame to start your vacation with a luxurious business class flight only to have your holiday ruined with unsafe ground transport.&#60;/p&#62;

You’ll delight in fresh pastries baked by celebrated pastry chefs, English classics like scones and clotted cream and bountiful teas.</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;p&#62;There&#38;#8217;s more to a decadently satisfying London holiday than booking a luxurious first class flight, staying in the high-brow Kensington neighborhood and partying in Mayfair and Soho. An English holiday simply isn&#38;#8217;t complete until you&#38;#8217;ve enjoyed a cuppa from one of London&#38;#8217;s most treasured tea houses. Here are just a few of our favorites:&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Claridge&#38;#8217;s&#60;br /&#62;
    Known around the world for its elegant but never stuffy ambiance, Claridge&#38;#8217;s serves a host of English favorites like scones, Cornish clotted cream, Marco Polo tea jelly and cucumber sandwiches. Of course, there are dozens of other delicacies, as well, such as chocolate pastries, creme brulee, chicken sandwiches and fruit-topped pastries. Live piano and cello music accompany diners enjoying the edible delights.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    The Orangery, Kensington Gardens&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    A palace atrium is the perfect setting for visitors to savor tea and champagne while gazing at Kensington Palace&#38;#8217;s magnificent gardens. Built by Queen Anne in 1704 to protect her beloved orange trees, The Orangery now charms visitors, business professionals and high society alike with its afternoon tea menu of smoked salmon and cream cheese mini bagels, cucumber and fresh mint sandwiches, Coronation chicken wraps and delectable pastries.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;

    Gilded statues, ornate decor and a spectacularly designed ceiling add a lavish touch to tea at The Ritz&#38;#8217; Palm Court. The Ritz is so steeped in grand architecture, in fact, that it&#38;#8217;s worth hopping on a discounted business class flight to London just to experience the hotel&#38;#8217;s ambiance.&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;The Ritz honors its 100-year-old high tea tradition by serving handmade sandwiches with all of the traditional British fillings, fresh-baked scones, Devonshire clotted cream, a variety of pastries and 16 loose leaf teas.

From luxury airport transport and private butlers to luscious spa treatments, Burj al Arab Jumeirah is the place to stay.</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;p&#62;Billing itself as the world&#38;#8217;s most luxurious hotel, Dubai&#38;#8217;s Burj al Arab Jumeirah&#38;#8217;s confidence is well-deserved. It repeatedly earns top accolades from luxury travel magazines and organizations and is a welcome respite for discerning travelers who expect first-rate service after a long, business class flight.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    The hotel&#38;#8217;s consummate service actually begins at Dubai International Airport. There, resort staff meet you with a chauffer-driven Rolls Royce or a private helicopter ready to whisk you away to the elegant hotel. From the Rolls, you&#38;#8217;ll be treated to your first glimpse of the magnificent sail-like architecture that defines Burj al Arab. The helicopter ride is a treat in itself, giving you an incredible view of gleaming Dubai and the one-of-a-kind scene of islands designed to form palm trees and sea horses. Your breathtaking landing puts you atop the 28th level, offering even more spectacular views.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Once inside the hotel, the polished service continues with private reception areas on each floor and options for private butlers who anticipate your every need. Every guest room in the hotel is a suite, designed in a modern style with a nod to Arab tradition and aesthetics. Even the most modest one-bedroom suite is a two-story delight with incredible views of the Arabian Gulf and majestic beds that invite you to sleep away the jet lag from your tiring but affordable first class flight.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;While the suites&#38;#8217; accommodations, service and views may tempt you to stay in your rooms for the duration of your trip, there are plenty of treasures to be found in the rest of the hotel. For recreation, the hotel offers four swimming pools and a private beach, free access to Wild Wadi Waterpark, a fitness center and a kids&#38;#8217; club.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    After a day spent shopping in Dubai&#38;#8217;s glittering, world-class malls or sightseeing through the desert, there&#38;#8217;s nothing more alluring than a pampering treatment in the hotel&#38;#8217;s Talise Spa. The spa is actually a destination in its own right, frequently earning awards as the world&#38;#8217;s most luxurious spa. The spa menu includes aqua retreats, saunas, body wraps and a wide variety of massage options.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Dining is equally sumptuous at Burj al Arab, ranging from an unforgettable repast under the world&#38;#8217;s tallest atrium to al fresco dining while star gazing. Each of the hotel&#38;#8217;s nine restaurants and lounges are distinct in ambiance and flavor, but all offer impeccable service and perfectly executed dishes and drinks.&#60;/p&#62;

Even if you’ve flown abroad with luxuriously discounted business class tickets, high tea in Canada, Malaysia, Thailand and Japan can soothe a travel-weary soul.</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;p&#62;It&#38;#8217;s always reassuring to look forward to a touch of tradition and warm comfort after a long first class flight abroad. Sipping afternoon tea and savoring palate-pleasing dishes a luxurious top-tier tea room is one of those prized treats that help ease a trip to a foreign land.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    The Grand Empress, Victoria, Canada&#60;br /&#62;
    The Grand Empress is imposing with its grand facade and its majestic locale facing the Inner Harbour and the regal British Columbia Parliament building. That grandeur continues to the Grand Empress&#38;#8217; interior and tea room, where luscious tapestries adorn the walls and tables are hand-carved. Tea has been served at the hotel since 1908, featuring the hotel&#38;#8217;s signature scones, tasty sandwiches and a variety of pastries. The elegant, traditional high tea fare is served on William Edwards china and accompanied by soothing live piano music.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    The Eastern &#38;amp; Oriental, Penang, Malaysia&#60;br /&#62;
    One of the last things most modern travelers expect to find in the lush, tropical locale of Malaysia is a formal high tea service. At The E&#38;amp;O, though, afternoon tea is quintessentially British, hearkening back to the colonial era where Brits savored Malaysia&#38;#8217;s benefits. Served in the luxury hotel&#38;#8217;s restaurant 1885, the sweet menu of petit-fours and chocolate-dipped strawberries are complemented with savory sandwiches of salmon, roast beef, cucumber and other fillings. Tea is served on classic blue-and-white porcelain dishes, and the setting is soothing with candlelight, paneled walls and plush seating.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;Peninsula Hotel, Tokyo, Japan&#60;br /&#62;
    Wherever you fly on your luxurious business class flights, a Peninsula Hotel is likely waiting with its world-renowned high tea. The hotel&#38;#8217;s Tokyo property is one of the reasons for the company&#38;#8217;s reputation for serving a blissful afternoon tea. Its authentically British service includes delicacies like chocolate and pistachio pound cake, fromage mousse and homemade scones, all served on graceful bone china. Offered in the chic, modern setting of The Lobby, the traditional tea is the perfect counterpoint to a bustling, contemporary hotel and city.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Erawan Tea Room, Bangkok, Thailand&#60;br /&#62;
    Blending Thai and British tradition and cuisine, the Erawan&#38;#8217;s tea service is flavorful, colorful and unique. Tea, of course, is the beverage of choice with a wide variety of herbal teas like Bael Fruit Tea. Savory dishes veer toward Thai classics like chicken-curry in pastry puffs, Mar Hor and the delicious lime, coconut, chili and ginger dish of Mieng Krathong Thong. For dessert, guests can expect Chocolate Pudding and other British treats. Tea is such a lovely experience at the Erawan that Lonely Planet named it one of the world&#38;#8217;s best. The semi-casual atmosphere and relaxing ambiance are a welcome respite from the cacophony of busy Bangkok, and the price is a perfect complement to the deals you found on discounted first class tickets to Thailand.&#60;/p&#62;

We review the ways the new luxury resort and a first class flight to the region can enrich your journey.</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;p&#62;The recent opening of the five-star Phum Baitang resort near Cambodia&#38;#39;s Angkor temples reminds us that you don&#38;#39;t have to make-do with uncomfortable lodging, even if you are on an enlightening or spiritual journey. So book those discounted &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/service/one-way-business-class-tickets&#34;&#62;business class tickets&#60;/a&#62; to Siem Reap International Airport, and we&#38;#8217;ll list the reasons you&#38;#8217;ll love Phum Baitang just as much as we do.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Authentic Cambodian design&#60;br /&#62;
    Just minutes from Siem Reap, the resort is tucked into the Cambodian countryside so it&#38;#8217;s fitting that the property&#38;#8217;s 45 villas resemble traditional Cambodian architecture. The resort&#38;#8217;s stilted villas are made of wood, mimicking the appearance of local farming houses. Palm trees and paddy fields surround the villas, creating the perfect setting for a resort whose name is Khmer for &#38;#8220;green village.&#38;#8221;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Serene Villas&#60;br /&#62;
    The collection of villas themselves offer a sense of privacy, but their artful scattering around the property makes you feel as if you are part of a small town. Furnishings and amenities offer a dash of luxury, with some of the villas featuring private terraces and others offering private plunge pools. Spacious and relaxing outdoor lounging spaces are worked into the design of each of the villas, and the soaking tubs and roomy bathrooms are nothing short of sublime. Antique wooden furniture in keeping with the Cambodian aesthetic, luxurious linens, comfortable sofas and dozens of other amenities fill the villas with cozy warmth and indulgent pleasure.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Plenty of Relaxation&#60;br /&#62;
    The on-site Spa Temple is intimate and rejuvenating, giving you delightful opportunities to enjoy a massage, practice yoga or simply meditate in a tranquil, candle-filled setting.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;If you prefer a little pampering, the spa offers a steam room, a sauna and seven treatment rooms for single or couples massages. There&#38;#8217;s also a fitness room and yoga pavilion for times when you feel the need to stretch and work your muscles, especially after your long, business class flight to Cambodia.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Sumptuous Services and Enrichment&#60;br /&#62;
    Cooking classes with the resort&#38;#8217;s chef help you master the art of Cambodian cuisine and learn about local produce on chef-led trips to the local market. A concierge is on staff to help you enjoy all of the Khmer experiences you want, and an on-site kids club gives your children a chance to learn more about the Khmer culture. The resort&#38;#8217;s boutique is fully stocked with local wares, perfect for souvenirs of your time in Cambodia.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Unique Experiences&#60;br /&#62;
    Phum Baitang puts you in the heart of amazing Cambodian landmarks and experiences. Be sure to take the trek out to the Temples of Angkor archeological park to explore some of the most important relics of the Khmer Empire. Nearby, you&#38;#8217;ll also find the magnificent and extremely biodiverse Tonle Sap Lake, Phnom Kulen National Park and captivating villages of Kompong Phluk. Make time to head into Siem Reap, too, so you can explore the Phsar Chas market in the Old French Quarter. You can also enjoy the region with special helicopter rides, Vespa tours, Vintage Jeep tours or buffalo cart rides.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    However you choose to spend your time in Cambodia, the Phum Baitang will keep you so relaxed and pampered that you won&#38;#8217;t want to get back on that airplane home, even if you&#38;#8217;ve booked spacious &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/service/first-class-specials&#34;&#62;first class seats&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;

We review some of the Christmas Markets’ best features, local activities and five-star hotels. Now’s a great time to book your business class flights to Strasbourg to enjoy the activities.</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;p&#62;Nothing gets you in the holiday spirit better than the delectable scents, sparkling lights, scrumptious treats and rousing bonhomie found in Europe&#38;#39;s famed Christmas markets. Luckily, now&#38;#39;s the perfect time to book discounted business class tickets to Strasbourg to experience the ultimate of all holiday markets, Christkindelsm&#38;auml;rik.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Repeatedly voted the best of Europe&#38;#39;s Christmas markets, Christkindelsm&#38;auml;rik is also the oldest, established in 1570. From the end of November to December 31, Strasbourg is enveloped by Christmas, offering 300 chalets filled with luscious baked goods, local crafts, aromatic pine trees, chorale and dance performances, holiday parades and all the special touches that make an Alsatian holiday so enticing. With 11 different Christmas markets spread throughout the village, visitors can spend weeks enjoying them all. If you don&#38;#39;t have that much time, here are a few highlights you shouldn&#38;#39;t miss:&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    The Great Christmas Tree in Place Kl&#38;eacute;ber, in the Village of Sharing, is stunning at 98-feet tall. As the centerpiece of the market, new lighting effects on the tree are revealed each week, making each visit to the tree a delightful surprise.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    The Christmas lights throughout the city are spectacular, but the display creating the entrance to the market is magnificent.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    If you have kids in your party, you can&#38;#39;t miss the outdoor ice rink in Place Dauphine. Reserved for kids, the ice rink is a great way for little ones to burn off some of that extra energy.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;Best of all, if you&#38;#39;re looking to engage in some fantastic winter sports, you won&#38;#39;t even need to hop onto another &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/continent/to-europe&#34;&#62;first class flight to another European city&#60;/a&#62;. The region&#38;#39;s exciting ski resorts are just an hour or two from Strasbourg. To the east and south are Germany&#38;#39;s famed Black Forest ski resorts, including Sasbachwalden, Steinach and Baiersbonn. For those who want to stay in France, the exquisite Vosges Mountain ski resorts are just two hours to the southwest.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    After a day spent skiing or relishing the city&#38;#39;s Christmas markets, there are several pampering five-star hotels in Strasbourg perfect for resting and recharging. Sofitel Strasbourg Grande Ile is the epitome of luxury in the heart of Strasbourg&#38;#39;s historic center. Colorful public areas lead to beautifully appointed guest rooms filled with classically lush furnishings and linens.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Chateau d&#38;#39;Ile is close enough to the historic areas to be convenient but far enough away to provide a little extra peace and quiet. This small boutique luxury hotel&#38;#8217;s room are lavish and comfortable, many offering views of the river, private saunas and relaxing balconies.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;

Fly in first class luxury to Budapest and board the lavishly appointed Golden Eagle Danube Express. You’ll explore ancient European towns, see legendary Romanian sites and revel in Venice.</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;p&#62;With the abundance of &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/service/first-class-specials&#34;&#62;cheap first class flights&#60;/a&#62;, five-star cruise lines and bespoke land tours, it&#38;#39;s easy to forget about the luxury options of traveling by train. We are especially enchanted by the possibilities offered by Golden Eagle&#38;#39;s summer Balkan Odyssey. The land cruise whisks travelers through some of the world&#38;#39;s most historic and beautiful European cities and countrysides.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    This breathtaking summer adventure begins in gorgeous &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/city/to-budapest-bud&#34; title=&#34;First class flights to Budapest&#34;&#62;Budapest&#60;/a&#62;, where travelers enjoy views of the Danube River, the stunning Buda Castle and other exquisitely designed buildings, public spaces and landscapes. Once travelers arrive in Budapest, they are chauffeured to their five-star hotel where they&#38;#8217;ll stay for two days so they can relish the spectacular sights of Buda and Pest.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    After a glorious day exploring Budapest&#38;#39;s World Heritage Sites, travelers board the Golden Eagle Danube Express, where spacious deluxe cabins with ensuite bathrooms offer every conceivable high-end amenity. Guests have access to 24-hour personal service, a bar lounge car and an impeccably appointed dining car. An executive chef oversees all meals to ensure that guests have a delightful culinary experience throughout the 12-day journey.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    From Budapest, the train glides on to other Hungarian towns like Lajosmizse to see a &#38;quot;Puszta&#38;quot; horse show and Kecskem&#38;eacute;t. In Romania, train stops in Sighisoara allow travelers to tour the site believed to be the birthplace of Dracula, and Brasov to roam Bran Castle&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;Days 5 and 6 are spent traveling through Bulgaria, stopping in historic towns like Veliko Tarnovo and Sofia.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    While we always appreciate the pampering convenience and speed of first class flights, this luxury train journey gives travelers a chance to experience the countryside and communities in a more intimate way. After Bulgaria, guests can explore the medieval tombs, fortresses and Turkish baths of Belgrade and the Ottoman Empire relics in Mostar. Travelers will even gain some insight into Sarajevo&#38;#39;s struggles during the Balkan War.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Next, it&#38;#39;s on to &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/country/to-croatia&#34; title=&#34;First class flights to Croatia&#34;&#62;Croatia&#60;/a&#62; to stroll through the ancient town center of Zagreb and Slovenia to explore the treasures of Ljubljana. The final two days of the luxury train tour take travelers through the celebrated Italian cities of Trieste and Venice. Once in Venice, guests transfer to a posh five-star hotel near Doge&#38;#39;s Palace, St. Mark&#38;#39;s Square and the Bridge of Sighs.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Since travelers aren&#38;#39;t locked into round-trip airfare, they can choose to linger in Venice even longer than Golden Eagle tour dates, soaking up the unique atmosphere and experiencing the tastes, sights and artistry of The Floating City. We are happy to help travelers find cheap first class airfare from Venice&#38;#39;s Marco Polo Airport so they can spend as much time in Venice as possible.&#60;/p&#62;

We take a look at the region’s celebrated Hotel Cala di Volpe and offer up discounted first class flights to help balance the hotel’s exclusive price tag.</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;p&#62;The Emerald Coast&#38;#8217;s Hotel Cala di Volpe received some notoriety this summer when it was named the second most expensive hotel in the world. The list reminded us that, unlike &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/service/first-class-specials&#34;&#62;discounted first class airfare&#60;/a&#62;, some luxury items just aren&#38;#8217;t meant to be cheap. It also piqued our interest in the Sardinian resort&#38;#8217;s amenities.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Just what does the double-room price of $1,789 buy at Cala di Volpe? Sumptuous linens, classic Mediterranean design, ceramic tile floors, whitewashed walls and private balconies are just a sampling of the hotel&#38;#8217;s guest room delights. The property also offers more exclusive, spacious suites with private terraces and deluxe suites with hand-painted Sardinian furnishings, picture windows, terraces and relaxing seating areas. The apex of the hotel&#38;#8217;s comfort is the three-bedroom Presidential Suite, featuring a rooftop terrace with ample deck chairs, a solarium, a private swimming pool and windows that let you bask in the beauty of the turquoise Mediterranean.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    The property itself is all that you expect when you book discounted first class tickets to the Costa Smeralda. The hotel appears almost like a Sardinian village, sprawling along the secluded bay. It features a private beach, incomparable views of the hills and visions of sailboats bobbing along the ocean.&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;Relaxing is easy in this romantic setting, especially with the on-site spa&#38;#8217;s soothing massage sessions and attentive bar service at the saltwater swimming pool.&#38;#160;Even with these tranquil amenities, the hotel is rich with recreation. Three tennis courts, a fitness center, access to the local Pevero Golf Club Costa Smeralda and other Sardinian offerings keep guests fit and actively experiencing the distinctive Mediterranean climate.&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
    Dining is delectable here. The Cala di Volpe Restaurant boasts a menu filled with traditional Sardinian and Mediterranean dishes like squash filled with creamy ricotta and fresh cannelloni overflowing with bechamel sauce and savory chopped beef. Its romantic, refined setting draws travelers and locals from all along the coast looking for an epicurean adventure. The resort&#38;#8217;s Barbecue restaurant is the place to go for fresh seafood grilled to perfection, and its wine tasting venue and bars add an extra touch of palate-pleasing delights.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    In a region known for its incredible seaside resorts and opulent amenities, the Cala di Volpe is a standout. So while it&#38;#8217;s terrific to save on discounted first class tickets, you&#38;#8217;ll appreciate the luxury and service of a more exclusive stay at Cala di Volpe.&#60;/p&#62;

We take a look at a few of the hotels appearing on Luxury Travel Magazine’s list of the 10 most expensive hotels so you can explore the world in style.</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;p&#62;Luxury travel may begin with booking luscious &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/service/first-class-specials&#34;&#62;first class airfare&#60;/a&#62;, but finding indulgent, pampering hotels is just as important. Luckily, there are plenty of gorgeous resorts around the globe to satisfy your exacting demands. This year, Polynesian delights and French Riviera gems are just a few of the hotels topping&#38;#160;Luxury Travel Magazine&#38;#8217;s&#38;#160;most expensive hotels list, and we recommend you try a few of them out. Last week, we profiled the list&#38;#8217;s No. 2 hotel, Cala di Volpe, but it&#38;#8217;s worth taking a look at some of the other hotels that made the Top 10.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Two U.S. hotels are featured on this year&#38;#8217;s list with Canyon Point, Utah&#38;#8217;s Amangiri hotel leading the pack. Known for its incredible location tucked among the canyon cliffs, Amangiri&#38;#8217;s $1,899-a-night fee includes a spacious suite, breathtaking desert views and access to adventures like hot-air balloon rides and fossil hunting. Maui&#38;#8217;s beautiful Montage Kapalua Bay hotel is No. 5 on the list.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Those of you booking first class tickets to the Mediterranean have a wide variety of high-end options from Luxury Travel Magazine&#38;#8217;s list. The Cote d&#38;#8217;Azur is home to two properties: Cap Estel and La Reserve.&#38;#160;With its stunning peninsula location, Cap Estel is just 10 minutes from Monaco, making it easy for guests to enjoy an elegant night at the tables.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;The magnificent hotel is acclaimed for its panoramic views, attentive service and dozens of chic amenities.&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;If you prefer the Italian Mediterranean, Sardinian hotels are well-represented on the list, taking three of the 10 spots. In addition to the previously featured Cala di Volpe, Hotel Pitrizza and Villa del Parco at Forte Village Resort are Nos. 6 and 9 on the list, respectively. Guests of the Hotel Pitrizza can sunbathe on the property&#38;#8217;s private beach, cool off in a seawater pool carved into the natural rock or head into town for a night of socializing, dancing and glamor. Best of all, some of the hotel&#38;#8217;s spacious rooms, villas and private suites feature spectacular views of the renowned Costa Smeralda.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Easter Island&#38;#8217;s Explora Rapa Nui hotel provides an ambrosial Polynesian experience, ranking No. 3 on the World&#38;#8217;s Most Expensive Hotel list at $1,733 a night. Guests here can disconnect from the rat race of everyday life, immersing themselves in the quiet of an island paradise.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Other hotels on the list include Chile&#38;#8217;s Explora Atacama and Venice&#38;#8217;s Aman Canal Grande, so even if you&#38;#8217;re&#38;#160;flying with &#60;span id=&#34;docs-internal-guid-f840b955-a437-4cfd-a70a-5fc7ceac5eb4&#34;&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;&#34;&#62;f&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/span&#62;irst class tickets to South America or inland &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/continent/to-europe&#34; id=&#34;first class tickets to Europe&#34; name=&#34;first class tickets to Europe&#34;&#62;European cities&#60;/a&#62;, there are many elite choices.&#60;/p&#62;

The zoo features Arctic animals like polar bears and huskies, and the science center delves into phenomena of the Northern Lights. Of course, the main draw here at Christmastime is the holiday village where kids can help Santa&#38;#8217;s elves with their chores and make cookies with Mrs. Claus. For lodging, check out the igloo hotel for a truly northern experience or look for luxury hotels like the Arctic Light Hotel and the Original Sokos Hotel Vaakuna Rovaniemi.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Quebec City, Canada&#60;br /&#62;
    If you&#38;#8217;d rather stay within North America, Quebec City is an excellent destination for those shorter first or business class flights. The city transforms into a Victorian town during the season, complete with carolers, candlelight and Victorian storytelling.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;Thousands of twinkling lights create magical experiences in neighborhoods like Rue de Petit-Champlain, Palace Royale, Grande All&#38;eacute;e and Sous-le-Fort Street.&#38;#160;The city&#38;#8217;s German Christmas market provides a glimpse into Old World traditions, but there are plenty of modern holiday touches like nighttime luge rides, Christmas concerts and the ice sculpture and 500,000 lights of Festi Lumiere. Quebec City is also home to several five-star hotels, including Auberge Saint-Antoine, Hotel Le Germain-Dominion and Fairmont Le Chateau Frontenac.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
    Rome, Italy&#60;br /&#62;
    Rome may not be the first place you think of when you plan your winter holidays, but it&#38;#8217;s actually a spectacular place to celebrate the season. Many of the city&#38;#8217;s streets are decorated with festive lights, and several Christmas markets offer abundant celebrations. Of course, the big draw during the holidays is the Pope&#38;#8217;s Christmas Eve Midnight Mass held at St. Peter&#38;#8217;s Basilica. Other magnificent experiences in Rome include outdoor ice skating, touring the many nativity scenes and enjoying the immense Christmas trees erected in St. Peter&#38;#8217;s Square, the Colosseum and Piazza Venezia. There&#38;#8217;s also a spectacular Menorah on display in Piazza Barberini to celebrate Hanukkah. &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/city/to-rome-fco&#34; title=&#34;Business class flight to Rome&#34;&#62;Rome&#60;/a&#62; is relatively easy to get to, and its busy Fiumicino Airport is a prime destination for finding &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/service/first-class-specials&#34;&#62;discounted first class airfare&#60;/a&#62;.&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;

After flying in luxurious business class seats to Mohammed V International, travelers can head to the Four Seasons to relax with lush guest rooms and lavish spa treatments.</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;p&#62;We don&#38;#8217;t often feature Casablanca in our blogs, but it is truly one of the most unique and captivating cities to visit. With 7.25 million people flying into Casablanca&#38;#8217;s Mohammed V International Airport each year, there are often discounted business class tickets available for the destination. As of last month, there&#38;#8217;s also a new spectacular luxury hotel in the city: the Four Seasons Casablanca.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    The only oceanfront hotel in the entire city, the Four Seasons is a marvel of plush accommodations, attentive service, intricate Arabic design and breathtaking scenery. Just 10 minutes from the business district, the hotel is a convenient retreat from bustling city activity. To add to the hotel&#38;#8217;s unique flair, it is set into the White City&#38;#8217;s oceanfront cliffs, and it is part of the high-end ANFA neighborhood featuring exclusive restaurants and shops. The Four Seasons is also near Hassan II Mosque, renowned for its breathtaking architecture and the tallest minaret in the world.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    The hotel&#38;#8217;s 183 guest rooms and suites are stunning, featuring all of the usual Four Seasons delights such as the Four Seasons bed, luxurious furnishings and twice-daily housekeeping service. Most rooms have balconies with incredible views of the Atlantic Ocean, the Corniche of Casablanca and other legendary local sites.&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;While all of the guest rooms are gorgeous, the hotel&#38;#8217;s Royal Suite is simply amazing. Floor-to-ceiling windows and a private terrace make the most of the suite&#38;#8217;s captivating views, and an indoor-outdoor fireplace is a soothing touch of warmth.&#38;#160;If you&#38;#8217;ve booked business class seats into Casablanca for a conference or event at the hotel, you&#38;#8217;re in for a superb treat. The meeting accommodations and ballroom are sublime, with an incredibly designed ceiling filled with bespoke chandeliers and lanterns.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    While on the property, be sure to take advantage of the hotel&#38;#8217;s many amenities, especially Le Spa. Offering a refreshing aquatic experience that incorporates experience showers, the spa provides whirlpools, steam rooms, an ice fountain, a 24-hour fitness center and a full menu of spa treatments. A resort-style pool and private cabanas are located in the hotel&#38;#8217;s fulsome gardens.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Dining and socializing on-site are equally pleasurable, with a choice of three restaurants and bars. French and Arabic cuisine and delectable libations are their specialties.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Even if Casablanca isn&#38;#8217;t your final destination, the Four Seasons is the perfect stopover for &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/service/one-way-business-class-tickets&#34;&#62;business class flights&#60;/a&#62; that continue on to other North African cities like Marrakech, Algiers and Tunis.&#60;/p&#62;

Here are a few of the most spectacular New Year&#38;#8217;s events that will start your new year off right:&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Hong Kong&#60;br /&#62;
    This glittering, frenetic city is already well-known for its nightly light and music productions played out on the city&#38;#8217;s skyscrapers, and its New Year&#38;#8217;s Eve show goes a step farther. Marking the new year, fireworks explode from the top of several high-rise towers around Victoria Harbour and barges shoot off colorful pyrotechnics, all choreographed to a lively musical score. The city is known for its glamorous hotels, so there are plenty of options for travelers. You can&#38;#8217;t go wrong with the Ritz-Carlton Hong Kong, InterContinental &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/city/to-hong-kong-hkg&#34; title=&#34;First class flight to Hong Kong&#34;&#62;Hong Kong&#60;/a&#62;, The Excelsior and Harbour Grand Kowloon, most offering holiday specials and packages.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Amsterdam&#60;br /&#62;
    Partying in Amsterdam is a unique experience, and it&#38;#8217;s even more so on New Year&#38;#8217;s Eve. The celebration here is less about grand fireworks displays and more about letting loose and dancing the night away.&#38;#160;Leidseplein, Nieuwmarkt and Rembrandtplein are popular hot spots, but memorable spectacles are held at nightclubs around the city and impromptu parties pop up all over town.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;Even with all of these parties, you may still want to check out the brilliant fireworks presentation at the Oosterdok.&#38;#160;To make your revelry as luxurious as possible, we recommend checking out our &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/city/to-amsterdam-ams&#34;&#62;first class deals to Amsterdam&#60;/a&#62; and five-star hotels like the Waldorf-Astoria, Grand Hotel Amrath, Sofitel Legend or InterContinental Amstel.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Sydney&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Be the first to count down the dawn of a new year by celebrating in beautiful Sydney. In fact, if you&#38;#8217;re so inclined, you can actually celebrate twice since Sydney&#38;#8217;s dazzling fireworks display over Sydney Harbour is held at both 9 p.m. and midnight. There are more than 50 official vantage points around the city that will give you a terrific view of the pyrotechnic show, but you can also get a front-row seat by opting for the NYE Above the Harbour experience. The special event is a unique way to experience the fireworks from the lawn above the Sydney Opera House, and it includes luxury amenities, from exclusive libations and a desert garden to dancing. Chic Sydney is also known for its stellar hotels, so revelers have countless elegant lodging options. We always enjoy the plush amenities of hotels like the Park Hyatt, 1888 Hotel, Sydney Harbour Marriott and Shangri-La Hotel Sydney. There are nearly 30 five-star hotels in the area, so you&#38;#8217;ll have ample choices after your first class flight touches down in &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/city/to-sydney-syd&#34; title=&#34;Flights to Sydney&#34;&#62;Sydney&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;

The museum is actually a year-round attraction, but there&#38;#8217;s something magical about visiting it in the winter. Ice chandeliers tower above visitors as they explore the museum&#38;#8217;s many ice sculptures or have a drink at the ice bar. The museum also features an ice spiral staircase leading to a magnificent observation tower. You can also take a few ice sculpting classes at the hotel.&#60;br /&#62;

Its newest makeover transforms the hotel&#38;#8217;s former glory into a palace fit for the 21st century, making it a destination so beautiful, you&#38;#8217;ll be glad you booked those last minute &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/country/to-switzerland&#34;&#62;business class flights to Switzerland&#60;/a&#62;.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Public Spaces&#60;br /&#62;
    While the hotel&#38;#8217;s noble Neo-Baroque and Art Nouveau facade remains the same, the interiors are completely redeveloped. There&#38;#8217;s still a hint of the palace&#38;#8217;s original Art Nouveau flavor, but it is melded into thoroughly modern, open spaces. Rich, warm colors fill the lobby/lounge, where guests can chat comfortably with other guests in sumptuous sofas and chairs. Up on the resort&#38;#8217;s roof, the Sky Terrace delights guests with 360-degree views of Lausanne, Lake Geneva and the breathtaking French Alps.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Restaurants &#38;amp; Lounges&#60;br /&#62;
    The hotel&#38;#8217;s restaurant is presided over by a Michelin-starred chef, bringing exciting culinary experiences to the Royal Savoy.&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;The restaurant is brasserie-style and comfortable whether you&#38;#8217;ve just returned from a morning on the slopes or you&#38;#8217;re ending a long day of business meetings with a fortifying repast. There&#38;#8217;s also an inviting cigar lounge for socializing, relaxing and enjoying a smoke.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Guest Rooms&#60;br /&#62;
    The accommodations are refreshing and delightful, and they&#38;#8217;ll have you making the Royal Savoy your first stop after disembarking from a long first class flight to Lausanne. Of the hotel&#38;#8217;s 196 guestrooms, 37 are opulent suites and junior suites suitable for those who need extra space and luxury. Guests who require exclusive privacy and service may inquire about the private floor suite.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    There is no shortage of glamorous, ornate hotels in Lausanne, but there&#38;#8217;s something special about staying in a palace hotel that was once the sanctuary of kings and queens. If you plan to book first class or &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/service/one-way-business-class-tickets&#34;&#62;business class deals&#60;/a&#62; to the region in the near future, a stay at the Hotel Royal Savoy Lausanne is well worth the time.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;br /&#62;
    If you just can&#38;#39;t get enough of couture, there&#38;#39;s no better way to ensconce yourself in fashion than to stay at the Armani Hotel Milano. Located in Milan&#38;#8217;s fashion district, Quadrilatero della Moda, the hotel is also the place to stay if you want solicitous personal attention. The hotel&#38;#8217;s legendary Lifestyle Managers are your hosts at the hotel, dedicated to anticipating your needs and guiding you to local restaurants, shops and events that provide a little something extra.

Tucked among the Society Islands, Tetiaroa boasts classic Polynesian hospitality. From private butler service to seawater air conditioners, the resort is the perfect blend of guest comfort and ecological preservation.</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;p&#62;Americans took about 100 million trips to the beach last year, but only a few of them snatched up first class airfare deals and took themselves off to The Brando luxury beach resort in French Polynesia. Located on the private island of Tetiaroa, The Brando is frequently named one of the top secluded beach enclaves, and&#38;#160;Cond&#38;eacute; Nast Traveller&#38;#160;recently included it on the magazine&#38;#8217;s list of the world&#38;#8217;s best private islands.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Part of the Society Islands&#38;#8217; Windward group, Tetiaroa has a long and fascinating history in its own right. Marlon Brando became entranced with the island while he was filming&#38;#160;Mutiny on the Bounty, buying the island in 1967. In the years that followed, he laid the groundwork for a resort that preserves and celebrates the Tahitian way of life in an environmentally conscious way. His children opened the resort in 2014.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Just getting to the island is a luscious exercise in slowing down and enjoying the journey. The best way to travel there is aboard first or business class seats to Papeete, Tahiti. From there, Air Tetiaroa&#38;#8217;s private eight-seater flies you to the island, giving you a spectacular bird&#38;#8217;s-eye view of the glistening turquoise water and gorgeous islands.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Once on the island, it becomes clear why Brando was enthralled by the island and its people. Tetiaroa is actually an atoll of 12 small picturesque islets surrounding a peaceful lagoon.&#38;#160;Warm tropical breezes rustle through hundreds of island palm trees, and the white sand beaches are idyllic lounging spots.&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;Sea turtles and tropical fish find a welcome haven in the atoll&#38;#8217;s underwater coral gardens, and guests discover their own paradise in the resort&#38;#8217;s 35 private villas.Each secluded villa is surrounded by more coconut trees and tropical landscape, providing the intimacy and privacy you expect. Villas are carefully designed to enhance the environment while delivering luxuries like refreshing plunge pools, outdoor baths and private beaches. Private butler service also ensures that you receive the attention you deserve.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
    While you may be tempted to simply kick back and relax the entirety of your stay, the activities are worth venturing outside your enclave. Demonstrations and lectures about Polynesian culture, snorkeling expeditions, scuba diving, stand-up paddle boarding, tennis and naturalist tours are just a few of the island&#38;#8217;s bountiful activities. The resort&#38;#8217;s spa offers a divine array of holistic treatment options and a sublime treetop couple&#38;#8217;s treatment area. If nothing else, you&#38;#8217;ll want to emerge from your secluded hideaway to enjoy the resort&#38;#8217;s brilliant cuisine. Its two restaurants feature Polynesian-inspired fare and the creations of Michelin-starred chef Guy Martin of Paris&#38;#8217; Le Grand V&#38;eacute;four.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Tetiaroa is just one of several exclusive private and semi-private islands to offer luxurious holidays. We&#38;#8217;ll explore more of our favorite beach sanctuaries in upcoming blogs, so you can put those savings you earned on &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/service/one-way-business-class-tickets&#34;&#62;discounted business class tickets&#60;/a&#62; to good, relaxing use.&#60;/p&#62;

Villa accommodations are luxurious, the dining is carefree and the lagoon bathing pools are heavenly. Although private, L’Ilot is also just 20 minutes away from world-class golf, shopping and dining.
</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;p&#62;In our previous blog, we detailed the delights of the semi-private beach resort The Brando. Today, we take you across the Indian Ocean to spectacular Mauritius where the private island L&#38;#8217;Ilot offers all the luxuries you desire. The flight to Mauritius from the U.S. mainland takes a full day so this is a time when you definitely need to make the trip in the comfort of first class or business class seats.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Although L&#38;#8217;Ilot is just 15 miles from the capital city of Port Louis, its location in the middle of a scenic lagoon off the Indian Ocean highlights its remote, secluded location. Only a wood and rock causeway connects the tiny rock island to the main island area of Roche Noires.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    The villa is contemporary in architecture but sumptuous in atmosphere. Walk down the steps in front of the villa to take a dip in the natural bathing pool. Cross the eastern jetty to enjoy a few hours of diving and exploring the open ocean. For a special treat, wait for low tide when the shallow sand banks are revealed.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    While you may just enjoy a few days of uninterrupted meditation and relaxation at the villa, there are plenty of thrilling adventures and fun activities nearby.&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;After all, you need to make the most of your day-long first class flight to Mauritius. The chic shops and restaurants of Grand Bay&#38;#8217;s &#38;#8220;Northern Riviera&#38;#8221; offer opportunities to socialize, and the renowned golf courses of The Legends and The Links are just 20 minutes away.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Back at the villa, two beautiful suites and two bedrooms envelop you in luxury. With a wide array of pillows and Egyptian cotton and linen bedding, even slumber is a holiday here. Both suites enjoy private verandas, and all bedrooms and living spaces boast panoramic views of the Indian Ocean. For meals, guests can either savor the gastronomic delights of an on-site chef or allow staff to deliver meals to the villa.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Cond&#38;eacute; Nast Traveller&#38;#160;named L&#38;#8217;Ilot one of the world&#38;#8217;s best private islands, and it easily lives up to that acclaim. Mauritius itself frequently earns accolades and was named the World&#38;#8217;s Leading Island Destination and the World&#38;#8217;s Best Beaches at the World Travel Awards.

    &#60;br /&#62;
    &#38;#8220;We love Europe in the winter because many of the crowds dwindle down and the picturesque cities and landscapes take on a character of their own,&#38;#8221; says Julia Graft, public relations manager for IFlyFirstClass. &#38;#8220;That&#38;#8217;s why we&#38;#8217;re so excited to be able to offer these incredible discounts.

    &#60;br /&#62;
    Here are just a few European cities with events and activities this winter:&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Venice&#60;br /&#62;
    Flying in lavish &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/city/to-venice-vce&#34;&#62;first class seats to Venice&#60;/a&#62; is the first step to truly relishing the drama, pageantry and mystique of Carnivale.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;From January 23 to February 9 this year, the city becomes a grand backdrop to the amazing costumes, breathtaking masks and opulent balls of Carnivale. While Marco Polo International Airport puts you closest to the festivities, you may also want to consider flying to Tuscany&#38;#8217;s Florence Airport or Milan-Malpensa Airport so that you can enjoy many of Italy&#38;#8217;s other treasures. Both are within a three-hour drive of Venice and are delightful destinations on their own.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    London&#60;br /&#62;
    Winter in London teems with activities, including the light and art spectacle of Lumiere London. Visitors can also enjoy breathtaking ice skating at the stately Somerset House, Winterville activities at Victoria Park, watching competitions at the International Horse Show and experiencing New Year&#38;#8217;s fireworks over the Thames.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Madrid&#60;br /&#62;
    Although it gets less attention than Venice&#38;#8217;s celebration, Madrid&#38;#8217;s Carnival is equally magnificent. For six days from the end of January to early February, revelers participate in elaborate costume competitions, watch parades and feast on edible Spanish delights. Festivities kick off with a reading from the balcony of Casa de la Villa and end with a dazzling farewell party and the traditional sardine burial. Intrigued to find out just what a ritual sardine burial involves?

The Al Maha Desert Resort &#38; Spa carries on this luxurious tradition, offering dazzling private villas in an Arabian Desert conservation area.</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;p&#62;Making the trek in lavish &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/city/to-dubai-dxb&#34;&#62;first class seats to Dubai&#60;/a&#62;, you expect to land at your destination to a world of breathtaking opulence. Even In a region where magnificent hotels are commonplace, though, Dubai&#38;#8217;s Al Maha Desert Resort &#38;amp; Spa still shines as a unique and spectacular resort in the Arabian Desert.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    With its incredible location in the middle of the Arabian Desert and its luscious furnishings and amenities, it&#38;#8217;s easy to see why Al Maha repeatedly ranks among the world&#38;#8217;s top luxury resorts. It&#38;#8217;s not everyday, after all, that you get the opportunity to stay among the endless miles of undulating sand dunes. For those of you who had childhood fantasies of living like a sheik in a desert oasis, the Al Maha is a dream come true.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Instead of a spacious tent, though, you&#38;#8217;ll stay in a beautiful private villa. Each of the 42 villas has its own private infinity pool and deck overlooking the Dubai Desert Conservation Reserve. You&#38;#8217;ll also enjoy 24-hour concierge service and a personal guide to handle all of your needs while you&#38;#8217;re at the resort.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Of course, you probably didn&#38;#8217;t arrange &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/service/first-class-specials&#34;&#62;first class airfare&#60;/a&#62; to Dubai just to stay in your suite. While it&#38;#8217;s not unusual to catch sight of gazelles and Arabian Oryx from your private pool deck, there are dozens of fascinating activities included with your stay at the Al Maha.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;You can embark on a safari to get a look at deep-desert wildlife, discover the world of falconry, careen up and down the dramatic dunes in a desert bashing vehicle or trek across the desert atop a camel.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Dining at Al Maha is an equally delightful activity, particularly when it comes to the resort&#38;#8217;s romantic dinners on the desert dunes. While the resort bills the experience as a picnic on a grand scale, that description understates the scene. Persian carpets are used to cover the sandy dune, and glowing torches surround the &#38;#8220;picnic&#38;#8221; area. The table is dressed in crisp, white linens,and the superb food and service put an exclamation point to the entire experience. There are several other dining options at the resort, including the Hajar Terrace Bar&#38;#8217;s al fresco dining and the Al Diwaan&#38;#8217;s refined, organic meals.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    There are dozens of other delights to be discovered at the Al Maha, from its refreshing spa services and its Bedouin-inspired decor to its welcoming meeting rooms. Enjoying all of the resort&#38;#8217;s amenities are easy since it&#38;#8217;s just a 50-minute drive from downtown Dubai. It&#38;#8217;s also a quick drive once your first class flight lands at Dubai International Airport. Winter and early spring are excellent seasons to travel to Dubai, so now&#38;#8217;s a great time to book discounted first class tickets to the region.&#60;/p&#62;

To help you start the new year on a blazing high note, IFlyFirstClass offers &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/service/one-way-business-class-tickets&#34;&#62;cheap business class tickets&#60;/a&#62; to Europe for winter travel dates. Last week, we listed some of the reasons you should consider a trip to Europe this winter. This week, we list even more fiery enticements to travel to the continent.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Scotland&#60;br /&#62;
    Immerse yourself in the Viking spirit with &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/country/to-scotland&#34; title=&#34;Flights to Scotland&#34;&#62;Scotland&#60;/a&#62;&#38;#8217;s legendary Up Helly Aa festival held on the last Tuesday of January. Lighting up the skies of the stunning Shetland Islands, this is the country&#38;#8217;s largest fire festival. The 24-hour festival start is announced with a rocket explosion and the lighting of the torches. A dazzling procession takes the crowd and flaming torches to a replica Viking ship where the &#38;#8220;Guizer Jarl,&#38;#8221; representing a different Norse character each year, appears. There, &#38;#8220;townsfolk&#38;#8221; cast their flaming torches into the ship, creating a bonfire unlike any you&#38;#8217;ve ever seen. The ensuing party lasts all night and throughout the morning. While Lerwick hosts the largest Up Helly Aa festival, eight other communities host their own version of the event throughout winter.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Valencia, Spain&#60;br /&#62;
    If your business class flight to Europe takes you to the southern mainland in March, check out Spain&#38;#8217;s incredible Fallas de Valencia from March 15 to 19. Honoring Saint Joseph, the five-day marathon celebration includes parades, fiestas, pageants and nightly fireworks displays.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;During the first four days of the celebration, each of the city&#38;#8217;s 750 neighborhoods holds a parade to present its spectacular, firecracker-filled cardboard and papier-mache fallas. The fallas are fascinating works of art depicting characters, humorous scenes and creative creatures. On the final night of the event, the city lights are dimmed and the firecracker-laden fallas are set afire.&#38;#160;The revelry, explosions and fires last throughout the night, with visitors and townspeople dancing in the streets, feasting and enjoying the town&#38;#8217;s many street vendors.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Greece&#60;br /&#62;
    While many communities celebrate the Easter season with spring-like colors, bunnies and palms, Greece holds its Rocket Wars or Rouketopolemos. The event is held on Chios Island, where two churches hurl 60,000 homemade &#38;#8220;rockets&#38;#8221; or firecrackers at the other&#38;#8217;s bell tower.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Italy&#60;br /&#62;
    The Explosion of the Cart event in Florence is held on Easter Sunday each year and carries on a 350-year-old tradition. On Easter morning, a priest lights the Easter candle that is used to light a cart of coals. The cart is also packed full of firecrackers. A parade carries the cart through town for presentation to the Archbishop. The Archbishop releases a flaming &#38;#8220;dove&#38;#8221; rocket that collides with the cart, setting off many explosions and celebrations.&#60;br /&#62;

IFlyFirstClass deals on first class seats can whisk you away to some of the continent’s most exciting events, including the Lemon Festival, Battle of the Oranges and Strong Beer Festival.</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;p&#62;It&#38;#8217;s never been a better time to book &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/page/last-minute-deals&#34;&#62;discounted first class tickets&#60;/a&#62; to Europe, especially with the recently released, limited-time deals offered by IFlyFirstClass. Whether you&#38;#8217;re traveling to Europe this winter for business or a much-needed vacation, there are plenty of ways to celebrate Europe&#38;#8217;s flair for celebration and edible delights. From oranges and lemons to hearty ale, it seems like there&#38;#8217;s a festival for every taste.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Ivrea Carnival, Italy&#60;br /&#62;
    Outlandish Mardi Gras revelry in New Orleans has nothing on &#38;#8220;Carnevale&#38;#8221; festivities in the Italian village of Ivrea. Rooted in the town&#38;#8217;s fascinating history of revolt against Medieval tyranny, Ivrea Carnival is a spectacle most known for its Battle of the Oranges. From Saturday to Tuesday before Lent, townspeople hurl oranges at groups representing tyrannical armies. With oranges flying from every corner of city streets and squares, it&#38;#8217;s easy to get caught in the crossfire. Donning the traditional red Phrygian hat will keep you mostly safe from the oranges while you enjoy a close-up view of the festivities.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Lemon Festival, France&#60;br /&#62;
    If Ivrea Carnival&#38;#8217;s Battle of the Oranges doesn&#38;#8217;t satisfy your taste for citrus, hop on a first class flight to France&#38;#8217;s gorgeous Cote d&#38;#8217;Azur. There, in the village of Menton, you&#38;#8217;ll find the captivating Lemon Festival. The celebration&#38;#8217;s parade is a breathtaking scene.&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;Floats exceed 30 feet in height and are filled with sculptures and scenes made with lemons and other citrus. The event lasts for three weeks from mid-February to early March and includes light-filled gardens, special exhibitions and other fun festivities.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Strong Beer Festival, Germany&#60;br /&#62;
    A tradition since the 1600s, Munich&#38;#8217;s Starkbierzeit celebrates the local strong beer, often referred to by locals as liquid bread. The beer, called Salvator, was created by local monks to sustain them through Lent, and it continues to be a signature beverage throughout the region. Starkbierzeit&#38;#8217;s four weeks of festivities begins in the middle of February with a televised tapping of a Salvator Doppelbock. For the next few weeks, each of the city&#38;#8217;s beer halls opens a marquee to serve the malty Doppelbock, host oompah bands and comedy shows and provide a venue for plenty of singing and dancing. Most also serve pretzels and sausages to complement the amber Doppelbock beer.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Europe&#38;#8217;s orange, lemon and beer celebrations prove that there is still opportunity to enjoy life, culture and food even during the stark days of winter. &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/service/first-class-specials&#34;&#62;First class deals&#60;/a&#62; available at IFlyFirstClass give you even more reason to relish winter &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/continent/to-europe&#34;&#62;trips to Europe&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;

</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/country/to-ireland&#34;&#62;Ireland&#60;/a&#62; is full of lush landscapes, fascinating history and thrilling cultural traditions. Many times, though, St. Patrick&#38;#8217;s Day celebrations are reduced to green beer, campy leprechaun images and an over-indulgence in corned beef and cabbage. If you&#38;#8217;re looking for a fresh way to honor the national, religious and cultural importance of St. Patrick, take advantage of IFlyFirstClass&#38;#8217; latest deals on first class flights to Europe. You&#38;#8217;ll find a host of interesting captivating monuments, events and displays honoring one Ireland&#38;#8217;s most beloved figures.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Armagh, Northern Ireland&#60;br /&#62;
    Armagh brings you both an entertaining St. Patrick&#38;#8217;s Day festival and meaningful historic sites. The ancient &#38;quot;Cathedral City of Ireland&#38;quot; hosts the largest St. Patrick&#38;#8217;s event in the country, lasting six days and attracting 20,000 visitors. It includes a colorful parade and a live musical concert.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Armagh is significant as the place St. Patrick established as the country&#38;#8217;s spiritual center in 445 AD, now the site of the Church of Ireland. In addition to the church, visitors can tour the Armagh County Museum and St. Patrick&#38;#8217;s Trian to see ancient artifacts revealing St. Patrick&#38;#8217;s role spreading Christianity throughout Ireland. Armagh is also an excellent launching point for following St. Patrick&#38;#8217;s Trail, a 92-mile path through some of Ireland&#38;#8217;s most important sites.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;County Down, Northern Ireland&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    The local Down Cathedral is on the grounds of St. Patrick&#38;#8217;s first established church.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;It is also the saint&#38;#8217;s burial site. Nearby is Saul Church, a site considered the Cradle of Christianity in Ireland for its importance to St. Patrick. Visitors of all Christian faiths are invited to worship with local congregants here on March 17, although visitors and pilgrims are welcome to see the church throughout the year.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Next to Down Cathedral is St. Patrick Centre. There, visitors can tour a gripping multimedia exhibition and browse local crafts. Visitors can also view a compelling IMAX film highlighting important sites in Ireland. Short of booking first class seats to all of Ireland&#38;#8217;s most beloved destinations, the IMAX film is one of the best ways to see the gorgeous country.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    A quick, 30-minute drive north takes visitors to Castle Espie, where St. Patrick&#38;#8217;s Day celebrations are whimsical and fun. Visitors can traipse through the castle&#38;#8217;s wetlands to discover laughing leprechauns, follow a shamrock trail, see St. Patrick&#38;#8217;s snakes and nosh on traditional Irish foods.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    There are dozens of other engaging sites and events throughout the country. Discovering Ireland in the footsteps of St. Patrick is a delightful way to enjoy Irish culture and history.

They help to ease the frustration of long layovers and the discomfort of early departures.&#38;#160;IFlyFirstClass, or IFFC, tracks the latest developments in first and business class lounges to ensure its customers receive the ultimate luxury travel experience. Today, IFFC announced its list of the world&#38;#8217;s best 10 airport lounges for 2016.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Criteria for this year&#38;#8217;s best airport lounges include the lounge&#38;#8217;s level of attentive service, culinary offerings, exclusive perks and inviting ambiance. Experts at IFFC also considered each lounge&#38;#8217;s ratings by industry publications, variety of services offered and availability of business space and amenities.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Topping this year&#38;#8217;s list is&#38;#160;&#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; title=&#34;last minute business class&#34;&#62;Cathay Pacific&#60;/a&#62;. The airline continues to wow its first class passengers with its Hong Kong airport lounge, The Wing. The lounge recently received a renovation that intensifies its spectacularly lush atmosphere. Setting its lounge apart from the rest is Cathay Pacific&#38;#8217;s private Cabanas. The private Cabanas offer luscious soaking tubs, rain showers and day beds as well as working space and amenities. Passengers also enjoy the lounge&#38;#8217;s The Haven restaurant, a champagne bar and spacious, well-equipped workstations.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;In&#38;#160;&#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/city/to-frankfurt-fra&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; title=&#34;cheap business class to frankfurt&#34;&#62;Frankfurt&#60;/a&#62;, Lufthansa reserves an entire terminal for its first class passengers. The first class terminal offers every imaginable luxury, including private chauffeur service via Mercedes-Benz or Porsche. Lufthansa&#38;#8217;s customers pass through private passport and security checkpoints at the first class terminal and enjoy services such as a private cigar lounge, napping rooms and refreshing showers. &#38;#8220;In the competitive luxury airport lounge market, Lufthansa hits all the right notes with its Frankfurt first class terminal,&#38;#8221; says Julia Graft, IFFC public relations manager.Air France makes its debut on IFFC&#38;#8217;s list with the air carrier&#38;#8217;s amenity-rich first class lounge at Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport. There, passengers don&#38;#8217;t even have to enter the airport at all. The air carrier&#38;#8217;s chauffeur service picks passengers up on the tarmac at their arriving flights and drives them directly to their departing airplanes.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;If there&#38;#8217;s a layover, passengers are delivered to La Premier lounge where the service is stellar. Special services include Biologique Recherche spa treatments and meals designed by triple Michelin-starred chef Alain Ducasse. There are numerous lounge chairs, day beds and armchairs for relaxing, and a personal assistant is assigned to each guest.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Large, open spaces give Qatar Airways&#38;#8217; Al Safwa first class lounge in Doha its tranquil and refreshing ambiance. The lounge opened in late 2015, and it&#38;#8217;s already a favorite of the world&#38;#8217;s upper-tier travelers. Arriving guests relax in comfort in private check-in facilities and enjoy equally exclusive immigration and security check stations. Spacious napping rooms, tasty champagne service, and versatile dining menus pamper guests. The superb staff-to-passenger ratio means that most guests enjoy extremely personalized service.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;&#38;#8220;That personalized service is critical in a very competitive market,&#38;#8221; Graft says. &#38;#8220;Carriers are increasingly distinguishing themselves by offering more intensely personal attention. While Lufthansa&#38;#8217;s Frankfurt terminal is often considered the benchmark purveyor of this service, more airlines such as Air France and Qatar Airways are now in the game as well.&#38;#8221;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Excelling in this personalized service, Thai Airways offers exclusive service at its first class lounge, the Royal Orchid, in Bangkok. Passengers receive a personal escort through check-in, immigration and security, and they&#38;#8217;re met at the gate by these assistants between connecting flights. The lounge also provides an sumptuous Royal Orchid Spa, offering a wide variety of spa treatments. Semi-private living rooms, nicely private napping rooms and a host of secluded spaces give guests plenty of room to recharge in comfort.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Rounding out IFFC&#38;#8217;s list of the 10 best airport lounges around the world are Qantas Airways&#38;#8217;s lush Sydney lounge, Emirates&#38;#8217; immense Dubai&#38;#160;&#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; title=&#34;cheap first class tickets&#34;&#62;first class&#60;/a&#62;&#38;#160;lounge, ANA&#38;#8217;s Tokyo lounge, Etihad&#38;#39;s new flagship lounge at Abu Dhabi and SWISS&#38;#8217; amenity-filled Zurich lounge.&#60;/p&#62;

Whether travelers are seeking an escape from the frigid temperatures of winter or looking for a snow-filled holiday, IFlyFirstClass’ destinations satisfy.</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;p&#62;&#38;#8220;Travelers today have thousands of excellent choices when it comes to wintertime travels,&#38;#8221; says Julia Graft, public relations director for IFlyFirstClass. &#38;#8220;&#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/service/one-way-business-class-tickets&#34;&#62;Discounted business class tickets&#60;/a&#62;&#38;#160;and first class deals are readily available, and interesting cities around the world continue to add new and exciting attractions. The annual list of top winter destinations is just one way we can help discerning travelers find destinations that suit their needs.&#38;#8221;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Topping this year&#38;#8217;s list is the popular Australian city of &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/city/to-adelaide-adl&#34;&#62;Adelaide&#60;/a&#62;, A Southern Hemisphere holiday is the perfect respite from winter&#38;#8217;s typical freezing temperatures. December to March is summertime in Adelaide, and travelers can expect balmy temps from 62 F to 85 F. That&#38;#8217;s warm enough for short sleeves but not oppressively hot. Adelaide has more than its weather going for it though. It&#38;#8217;s also a fun-filled, cosmopolitan city with hotels and resorts to suit every budget level. The city&#38;#8217;s fine and performing arts selections are particularly astute in March when Adelaide hosts its legendary Adelaide Festival. As a coastal city with the adventure-laden River Torrens running through it, Adelaide is also a popular site for recreationists.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;For luxury-lovers, IFFC names Abu Dhabi to its winter travel list. Travel to this gleaming city is already convenient with the region&#38;#8217;s second largest airport nearby. Abu Dhabi Airport will also open its newest Midfield passenger terminal in 2017, making travel through the airport even easier. Once travelers are in the city, they can expect abundant options for high-end hotels, designer boutiques and plentiful fine dining. The city&#38;#8217;s attractions are equally sumptuous, from desert safaris and Al Ain Palace Museum to Wadi Adventures and Yas Waterworld.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;Sun-seekers who want to stay within North America have many options for warm destinations in the southern United States. San Diego is one of the best of these southern U.S. cities, offering temperate days, mostly sunny skies and countless attractions and activities. Visitors can spend days playing on San Diego&#38;#8217;s many beaches or exploring world-class Balboa Park. The city also has an interesting Old Town, Spanish Mission, naval carrier museum and a renowned zoo. Winter is the prime time to see gray whales, so a whale watching or sunset cruise is always a good idea this time of year.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;For a different ski experience, IFlyFirstClass recommends trying out Hokkaido,&#38;#160;Japan. Hokkaido&#38;#8217;s northern position makes it the best locale to find soft, dry powder for skiing, boarding and playing. The region is also filled with superb resorts, some popular, bustling centers for international skiers. Other resorts in the region are a bit more remote and intimate. The island also has excellent cities like Sapporo and Asahikawa and hot springs resorts in Noboribetsu and Jozankei Onsen. Sapporo is also known for its cherry blossoms, so travelers with plenty of time to spare can stretch their holidays to include the April blossom displays.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;For much of the western world, winter is a time to celebrate Christmas, and it&#38;#8217;s impossible to ignore the abundant appeal of&#38;#160;&#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/continent/to-europe&#34;&#62;Europe&#60;/a&#62;&#38;#8217;s&#38;#160;many Christmas markets. Even those who don&#38;#8217;t observe Christmas enjoy these winter festivals. There are dozens of superb markets in Europe, Oceania and North America, but Salzburg is perennially one of the best. The city&#38;#8217;s famous market begins in November and runs through December each year, offering bountiful food, drink and revelry. Serene processions, rousing chorales, craft-filled markets and children&#38;#8217;s activities are just a few of the event&#38;#8217;s attractions. Visitors can watch the naughty antics of Krampus, visit St. Nicholas, warm up with a mulled wine drink and sample dozens of Christmas pastries and cookies.&#60;/p&#62;

The incredible white sand beaches and the azure Indian Ocean is irresistible. </summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;p&#62;No. 3: Como Maalifushi Resort&#60;br /&#62;
    It&#38;#8217;s nearly impossible to beat the gorgeous southwest Maldives location of Como Maalifushi. Located in the secluded Thaas Atoll, the resort is surrounded by pristine beaches. In the distance, you can see uninhabited private islands that call to mind picture postcards and fictional deserted islands.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    The resort is known for its luxurious villas perched over the water and its splendid beach suites. This posh lodging isn&#38;#8217;t just reserved for adults though. It&#38;#8217;s just as welcoming to families with kids as it is to young couples and retired gadabouts. This mix of guests gives the resort a comfortable, joyous atmosphere that makes you want to enjoy the resort to its fullest.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Picturesque wooden walkways guide you to your secluded overwater villas. You can lounge on your private deck, dipping your toes into the water every so often to cool down. Beds are draped elegantly in white, flowing netting, and a wide doorway opens to the sea. If you really want to feel part of the landscape, you can also choose the resort&#38;#8217;s garden rooms and beach suites. They&#38;#8217;re set in the island&#38;#8217;s lush tropical gardens and along the beach, and they&#38;#8217;re perfect for families. Beach activities are just steps away, and you even have the option of a private pool.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Like all excellent resorts, Como Maalifushi also houses a fabulous spa to really get you into relaxation mode. The Shambhala Retreat is known for its holistic approach to life. You&#38;#8217;ll luxuriate in the free yoga classes and private guided meditation and pranayama sessions. Amp up a little in the fitness room, then enjoy a bone-melting massage. From Dead Sea Mud treatments to soothing manicures, Shambhala Retreat pampers you from your head to your toes.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Dining at the resort is equally sumptuous. Local fishermen deliver fresh fish to the on-site restaurants every day. Chances are good that your dinner was swimming in the ocean outside your villa just hours before your meal. Aside from the fresh seafood, I appreciated the resort&#38;#8217;s attempt to appeal to all palates and diets. Fresh, healthy meals are always available at Madi. Sushi and sashimi are delightful at Tai. Relaxed meals of salads and pizza are enjoyed in Thila. Kids can also enjoy beach picnics, and couples can spark a little romance with private in-villa dining.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Well-planned provisions, extremely accommodating staff and pristinely kept grounds make this resort a treasure. It&#38;#8217;s not a surprise, then, that it earns so many nods from luxury travel reviews. In 2016, the resort was named the top luxury hotel spa in the Indian Ocean region by the World Luxury Spa Awards. In 2015, it earned Tattler Spa Award&#38;#8217;s Dream Spa Cuisine designation. That&#38;#8217;s not bad for a resort that opened in the summer of 2014.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;No. 2: One and Only Resort Reethi Rah&#60;br /&#62;
    Beautifully situated on the north side of the Male Atoll, One and Only Reethi Rah is a study in opulent pampering. This pampering begins even before you set foot on the resort grounds. Once your plane lands at Male Airport, you&#38;#8217;ll travel to the resort via luxury yacht, seaplane or private speedboat. Its service is so legendary that&#38;#160;&#60;em&#62;Conde Nast Traveller&#60;/em&#62;&#38;#160;recently named the resort the Best Overseas Hotel Spa and Traveller&#38;#8217;s World Awards ranked it the second Most Beautiful Hotel Spas.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    The all-villa resort&#38;#8217;s accommodations are plush and elegant, in keeping with the local aesthetics. Beach villas boast quaint thatched roofs and spacious, relaxing verandas. Laze the day away on a hammock outside your door, or play on the adjoining beach. Two-villa residences give extra privacy and convenience if you&#38;#8217;re traveling with another couple or family. Other options include grand beach villas and exquisite water villas.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    I especially enjoy the resort&#38;#8217;s multi-cultural dining. The blend of French, Italian and Asian flavors in Reethi Restaurant are bold, contemporary and delightful. For a truly stunning experience, you must dine at least once in Tapasake at sunset. The waterfront Japanese restaurant offers modern fare and breathtaking views. Perhaps the resort&#38;#8217;s most unique treat, though, is its beachside dining at Fanditha. Here, you&#38;#8217;ll relax on sofas in your private cabana to enjoy the Middle Eastern fare. Several other restaurants offer salads, seafood and grilled foods in picturesque, accommodating settings. Savor a nightcap and mingle with other guests in the resort&#38;#8217;s many bars, or allow the resort to arrange a romantic beachfront dinner.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    You won&#38;#8217;t need to worry about gaining weight from all the resort&#38;#8217;s lush food though. Activities are plentiful here. Snorkeling and diving are, of course, one of the first activities guests enjoy. The sea life is incredible, the water is refreshing and the setting could not be more dazzling. There are countless other ways to stay active and entertained on the resort property too. There&#38;#8217;s tennis, an art studio, a towering climbing wall and shopping on site. You can also waterski, paraglide, wakeboard or rent a speedboat in the Water Sports Centre.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    The One and Only Reethi Rah resort&#38;#8217;s spa is the perfect counterpoint to all that activity. The spa incorporates indigenous Ayurvedic principles into its treatments and sessions for an enriching, harmonious experience. You can opt for a variety of massage treatments and revel in a wide range of body therapies. The spa also offers facial treatments and signature therapies. Men aren&#38;#8217;t left out of this pampering, either, since the spa offers treatments for men and couples. There are even family spa treatments available.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    If you want a friendly, welcoming experience that brings in some of the local traditions, One and Only Reethi Rah is perfect for you.&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;div&#62;CHICAGO - Today, IFlyFirstClass&#38;#39;s travel experts announced the company&#38;#8217;s selection of the top five business class cabins for 2017. The business class providers on this year&#38;#8217;s list provide extensive amenities, attentive service and well-planned seat configurations. Most of the airlines earning this year&#38;#8217;s distinction also offer unique or innovative services and accommodations.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    &#38;#8220;IFlyFirstClass built a reputation for providing travel excellence, and it&#38;#8217;s important that we help our clients find the flights that best suit their needs,&#38;#8221; said Julia Graft, public relations director for IFlyFirstClass. &#38;#8220;To aid this process, we constantly evaluate the service our clients receive from the airlines and rate the luxuriousness of their first and business class cabins. The result of our evaluation is our annual list recognizing air carriers&#38;#39; best practices.&#38;#8221;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#38;#160;&#60;/div&#62;

    &#60;p&#62;IFlyFirstClass recognizes the five top business class cabins equally, with each airline offering its own special perks. &#38;#8220;In the past, we have ranked these selections No. 1 through 5, but this year&#38;#8217;s selections offer their own unique features,&#38;#8221; said Graft. &#38;#8220;They&#38;#8217;re all equally superb in their own way, and we feel confident recommending them to our travelers based on their own individual travel needs.&#38;#8221;&#60;/p&#62;

    &#60;div&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/div&#62;

    &#60;div&#62;One of the most exciting new offerings is &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/airline/delta&#34;&#62;Delta Airlines&#60;/a&#62;&#38;#8217; Delta One business class cabins. These cabins consist entirely of business class suites. Delta is the first airline in the world to offer this level of privacy in a business class cabin. A sliding pocket door gives travelers entry into their own private in-air oasis. Seats recline to a full-flat position, extending to 81 inches to accommodate patrons of all heights. The all-suite cabins also feature high-resolution entertainment screens, ample electric power sources and five-course meals. Transpacific flights will offer Tumi amenity kits, Kiehl toiletries and Westin bedding. &#38;#8220;We&#38;#8217;re excited by the privacy and amenities provided by Delta One suites,&#38;#8221; Graft said. &#38;#8220;Sadly, our travelers will have to wait a bit to enjoy the features since they won&#38;#8217;t come online until the fall of 2017.&#38;#8221;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Perennial favorite &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/airline/qatar-airways&#34;&#62;Qatar Airlines&#60;/a&#62; continues to offer excellent business class cabins and service. Known for its attention to detail, Qatar&#38;#8217;s business class travelers enjoy seats that recline to a fully flat position. On-demand dining accommodates all manner of personal schedules and nutrition needs, and the entertainment system is generous. Passengers can refresh with their amenity kits filled with Giorgio Armani toiletries and accessories.&#60;/div&#62;

    &#60;div&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/div&#62;

    &#60;div&#62;​Renowned for its unparalleled service, Singapore Airlines also makes the IFlyFirstClass list for its second consecutive year. Singapore&#38;#8217;s business class cabins are known for their wide seats that recline flat to a 78-inch bed. The newest business class seats go a step beyond typical seating, offering two intermediate seating positions that promote back comfort. The company is also known for its superior cuisine and convenient &#38;quot;Book the Cook&#38;quot; service.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Etihad&#38;#8217;s business class cabins remain on IFlyFirstClass&#38;#8217; 2017 list, a testament to the enduring quality of the airlines&#38;#8217; business class service. The air carrier continues to elevate its service with each iteration of business class cabin. The newest design features a seat that lies fully flat and massages its occupants. The company also removes some of the isolation that can make travel difficult by providing an in-air business class lounge. The &#38;quot;Lobby&#38;quot; lounge is the perfect spot to socialize with other business class passengers while enjoying a drink or a snack.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/airline/american-airlines&#34;&#62;American Airlines&#60;/a&#62; rounds out the list of top business class cabins with its latest design, the Super Diamond. When reclined flat, Super Diamond seats extend to 79 inches long so even tall passengers can enjoy comfortable rest on long flights. Its menu offerings are equally capacious, created by acclaimed chefs. In addition to comfort, special thought was given to entertainment on American&#38;#8217;s new Super Diamond business class cabins. Passengers enjoy 18-inch entertainment screens with access to 300 movies.&#60;br /&#62;

    &#38;#8220;The business class passenger market is highly competitive, and we&#38;#8217;re delighted that the airlines continue to innovate their provisions,&#38;#8221; Graft said. &#38;#8220;Passengers benefit with this increasing attention to service and accommodation.&#38;#8221;&#60;br /&#62;

To help travelers save on their holiday flights, hotels and entertainment, luxury travel experts at I Fly First Class offer seven tips for saving on high-season travel.</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;p&#62;First, many travelers will find savings simply by using a smaller airport near their destination. The world&#38;#8217;s major airports are usually extremely crowded during major holiday seasons. Flying into or out of a nearby regional airport not only saves money, it also helps travelers avoid the time-consuming crowds found in large airports. For Los Angeles, travelers can try Santa Ana, Burbank or Long Beach airports. Instead of &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/city/to-london-lgw&#34;&#62;London, Gatwick Airport&#60;/a&#62; is a good alternative. In place of Paris&#38;#8217; Charles de Gaulle, many travelers prefer Orly. Most major cities have at least one nearby regional that offers better value and more convenient service.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Second, timing is everything when it comes to booking upcoming travel. Travelers who need to schedule a last minute flight will find better deals through a reputable travel agency. That&#38;#39;s especially true for those services like IFlyFirstClass that specialize in discount luxury and &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/page/last-minute-deals&#34;&#62;last minute fares&#60;/a&#62;. Overnight, red-eye flights are also usually cheaper than daytime flights.&#38;#160;&#60;span data-term=&#34;goog_2029257767&#34; tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&#62;Tuesday&#60;/span&#62;,&#38;#160;&#60;span data-term=&#34;goog_2029257768&#34; tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&#62;Wednesday&#60;/span&#62;&#38;#160;and&#38;#160;&#60;span data-term=&#34;goog_2029257769&#34; tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&#62;Thursday&#60;/span&#62;&#38;#160;flights are usually less expensive options too.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Rather than incur frustrating fees for checked baggage, travelers should also consider some economical alternatives. Those traveling with holiday packages should get an estimate on the cost of posting the packages ahead of time. In many cases, it&#38;#39;s cheaper to send packages in the mail in order to avoid the cost of checking extra baggage at the airport. Sending packages ahead of time also helps travelers avoid the hassle of carrying extra baggage around the airport. If travelers simply must bring holiday gifts on their flights, they should check to see if their airlines offer discounts to certain credit card holders or association members. A final way to save on checked baggage fees involves a bit of risk. Some airlines offer passengers complimentary baggage check immediately before boarding to help balance the plane&#38;#8217;s load. For travelers who are willing to take a chance, this spur-of-the-moment baggage check is a money-saving boon.&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;div&#62;There are a variety of ways to save on ground transportation too. In this area, a little research before the trip can pay big dividends. Rental car companies in popular tourist destinations often offer discounts when cars are booked online. Again, travelers should check their credit union, credit card and alumni memberships for potential discounts on rental car companies. Avoiding the rental car cost completely is also a good option, especially if travelers are uncertain about driving in unfamiliar or snowy, icy conditions. Most major airports have commuter trains and buses available on-site to provide transport to the city center.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    With house-sitting, house-swapping and vacation rental apps now widely available, travelers have more affordable lodging options than ever. Travelers can sign up for house-sitting services or check into house-swapping availability for the greatest savings. The benefits of these options also ensure that travelers have the use of a kitchen, thereby saving money on dining costs too.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Booking a stay at mom-and-pop hotels and bed and breakfast facilities are also good ways to save on lodging costs. They offer a homey, more personal atmosphere that is often appreciated during the holidays.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Finally, travelers can save on travel expenses during the holidays by talking to locals in the destination city. Online travel and city forums can provide excellent information about local deals. Once in the destination city, travelers should continue to chat with locals around town. Residents can provide tips for affordable, good-quality restaurants in town as well as low-cost or free activities in the area.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    &#38;#8220;IFlyFirstClass is committed to providing travelers with low-cost, luxury flight options throughout the year,&#38;#8221; said IFlyFirstClass&#38;#160; Public Relations Director Julia Graft. &#38;#8220;Our travel experts are always happy to help consumers find the best bargains available, even during peak travel season.&#38;#8221;&#60;/div&#62;

</summary><bodyColumn_1>&#60;p&#62;&#38;#8220;Traveling can be grueling, and airport lounges are a vital element to alleviating some of that travel fatigue,&#38;#8221; noted Julia Graft, public relations director of IFlyFirstClass&#38;#160;. &#38;#8220;Our annual Top 5 list helps keep our travelers informed about the best services available to them during their travels.&#38;#8221;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    The 2017 list includes several airlines who earned a place on its 2016 list. The 2017 list also includes a few newcomers. &#38;#8220;Airlines around the world continue to develop new and exciting ways to attract new business class passengers,&#38;#8221; Graft said. &#38;#8220;Airlines are expanding their business class lounge service to new airports, too, so the network of excellent business class lounges continues to grow.&#38;#8221;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Topping this year&#38;#8217;s list is &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/airline/qatar-airways&#34;&#62;Qatar Airways&#60;/a&#62;&#38;#8217; Al Mourjan lounge in Doha&#38;#8217;s Hamad International Airport. The lounge opened in 2014, but it remains a top choice for savvy business class travelers into 2017. Inspired by some of the world&#38;#8217;s most exclusive resorts, the lounge is appointed with bronze walls, marble-covered surfaces and hand-crafted decor. Passengers can relax in privately screened areas or in social public spaces. They can grab a quick bite from the buffet or order from a detailed a la carte menu. They can relax in game rooms, family rooms or a children&#38;#8217;s nursery. Checking in at the office is convenient in the lounge&#38;#39;s fully equipped business center. Covering more than 107,000 square feet, the lounge is one of the largest in the world.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    &#38;#8220;Qatar Airways often sets the gold standard for its first and business class services, and the Al Mourjan lounge is no exception,&#38;#8221; Graft said.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    No. 2 on the Top 5 list is Cathay Pacific&#38;#39;s newly designed The Pier lounge in Hong Kong International Airport. This airy, uncluttered design invites passengers to settle in for a wide range of entertainment and relaxation.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    &#38;#8220;Cathay Pacific&#38;#8217;s Hong Kong lounge reappears on our list because it caters well to two types of travelers: those who want to relish the travel experience and those who are rushing off to their next flight,&#38;#8221; said Graft. &#38;#8220;It&#38;#8217;s rare for an airline to be able to equally serve the two groups, but Cathay Pacific strikes just the right balance.&#38;#8221;&#60;/p&#62;
</bodyColumn_1><bodyColumn_2>&#60;p&#62;In The Pier lounge, fast-lane travelers can grab a quick bite or drink from self-service food kiosks, a coffee cart and a noodle bar. Those in the &#38;#8220;slow lane&#38;#8221; can relax in a peaceful teahouse, lounge area and customized Solo lounge chairs. Shower suites are comfortably accessorized, and a relaxation room provides additional rejuvenation.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Cathay Pacific isn&#38;#8217;t the only airline to upgrade its renowned business class lounge. Turkish Airlines recently rebooted its Istanbul lounge, earning rave reviews. The newly redesigned lounge is spacious, covering two floors of the airport. Ample-sized storage lockers provide secure spaces for travelers&#38;#8217; belongings, and a kids&#38;#8217; room offers plentiful gaming. Other amenities include a reading room, computer stations, a billiards area, a movie room and ample dining and refreshment areas. Complimentary neck and shoulder massages add a personalized touch to the lounge&#38;#8217;s services.&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    At No. 4, &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/airline/singapore-air&#34;&#62;Singapore Airlines&#60;/a&#62;&#38;#8217; SilverKris lounge at Singapore&#38;#8217;s Changi Airport is a fan favorite. Unlike many other international business class lounges, the Changi SilverKris lounge offers a &#38;#8220;home away from home&#38;#8221; atmosphere. Passengers can relax in the living room area, fuel up in the dining room area and grab a snack in the kitchen area. The lounge also offers &#38;#8220;productivity pods&#38;#8221; for working.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#60;br /&#62;
    Rounding out the list at No. 5 is &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.iflyfirstclass.com/airline/united&#34;&#62;United Airlines&#60;/a&#62;&#38;#8217; new Polaris Lounge in Chicago&#38;#8217;s O&#38;#8217;Hare Airport. Part of United&#38;#8217;s new Polaris business class concept, the lounge is the first of many to be opened throughout 2017 and 2018. Travelers can grab a quick snack at the buffet or sit back and relax with a nice meal in the new lounge. Premium wines and spirits are served, and passengers can expect at-your-seat beverage service. The lounge also offers sleeping rooms, clothes pressing and laundry service, shower rooms and concierge service.&#60;/p&#62;
