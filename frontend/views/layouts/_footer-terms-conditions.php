After departure date, your unused airline ticket may have no residual value. If canceling, return the unused tickets to us for refund or credit. Most special, excursion, and discount tickets have various travel restrictions and may have a penalty for change or cancellation. Be sure you understand these restrictions. If you change your plans enroute, ask the airline to apply the value of your unused ticket toward the purchase of a new ticket. If a refund is due, obtain a receipt from the airline.
